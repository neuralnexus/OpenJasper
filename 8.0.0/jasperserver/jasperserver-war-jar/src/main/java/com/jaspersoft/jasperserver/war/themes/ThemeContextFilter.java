/**
 * This class extends Spring WebMVC framework to support themes on error pages.
 * Spring implements themes in org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet, which works fine for normal flow.
 * However, if exception happens in one of the servlet filter (for example,
 * Spring Security exception that denied access to a certain URL), spring:theme tag
 * is not available because theme objects are not set in a request.
 *
 * The code below replicates these settings as they are in DispatcherServlet (v.2.5.6.SEC01) with minor simplification.
 * and sets all objects earlier in the execution. Note that DispatcherServlet will set them again.
 *
 * Please, place this filter to be the first in the chain
