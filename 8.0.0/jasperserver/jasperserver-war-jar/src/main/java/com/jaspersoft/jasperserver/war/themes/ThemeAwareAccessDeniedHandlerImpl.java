/**
 * This class extends AccessDeniedHandlerImpl to make it theme aware.
 * Normal servlet dispatching is done by DispatchServlet which takes care of ThemeResolver.
 * However in case of flow errors (like, access to a view is denied), it happens before DispatchServlet.
 * To make error page be able to use themes, this class injects ThemeResolver info into request

 * @deprecated This class is not used any more but included to product for backward compatibility with customer's applicationContext-security.xml
