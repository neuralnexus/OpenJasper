Customer must duplicate unaltered copies of all proprietary notices incorporated in or affixed to any Protected Materials. Except as stated in the Agreement, Customer receives no other rights to use any of Licensor's Marks.

5. Confidentiality. 
a) Neither party shall disclose Confidential Information to any third party without the disclosing party’s prior consent. Confidential Information may only be disclosed to individuals that need to know such information, and on the condition that the individual is subject to a written agreement to protect information with terms as protective as this Agreement. For the purposes of this section, the definition of Licensor and Customer includes Affiliates of either party. Licensor may use data collected during the Term in an aggregated, anonymized form, provided that such data is aggregated from more than one customer and does not identify Customer, Customer employees, or Customers’ customers.
b) The duty to protect Confidential Information does not apply to information that is shown to be: 
i. available to the public other than by a breach of a confidentiality obligation; 
ii. rightfully received from a third party not in breach of a confidentiality obligation; 
iii. independently developed by one party without use of the Confidential Information of the other;
iv. known to the recipient at the time of disclosure (other than under a separate confidentiality obligation); 
v. produced in compliance with applicable law or court order, provided the other party is given reasonable advance notice of the obligation to produce Confidential Information (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the disclosing party’s cost, if the disclosing party wishes to contest the disclosure. 
c) Each party shall indemnify the other for any damages (including reasonable expenses) the other may sustain resulting from a breach of this Section. Money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for a breach of confidentiality. If either party breaches the confidentiality obligations, the non-breaching party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief without the necessity of posting a bond even if otherwise normally required. Such injunctive or equitable relief is in addition to all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity. 
d) Confidential Information remains the sole property of the disclosing party; except for rights explicitly granted in the Agreement, the receiving party does not acquire any rights to such Confidential Information.

6. Data Protection and Back-up.  
a) If Customer exposes Licensor to an individual’s Protected Data, Licensor will process and store such information pursuant to Licensor’s Information Security and Compliance Program found at https://terms.tibco.com/#security-guidelines, which include Licensor’s Data Processing Terms that apply when Licensor processes Protected Data on behalf of Customer that is subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU/2016/679) (GDPR)..

7. Indemnity.
a) Licensor shall, at its own expense, defend or at its option, settle, any claim or action brought against Customer to the extent it is based on a claim that the Software, or Materials, all as updated by Licensor and used in accordance with the Agreement, infringes any patent, copyright, or any trade secret of a third party. Furthermore, Licensor will indemnify and hold Customer harmless from and against damages, costs, and fees reasonably incurred (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that are attributable exclusively to such claim or action and which are assessed against Customer in a final judgment. Licensor’s obligations to defend, settle, or indemnify Customer are subject to (i) Customer promptly notifying Licensor in writing of such claim; (ii) Licensor having the exclusive right to control such defense and/or settlement; and (iii) Customer providing reasonable assistance (at Licensor's expense) in the defense thereof. Customer shall not settle any claim, action or proceeding without Licensor’s prior written approval.
b) LICENSOR SHALL NOT DEFEND, INDEMNIFY, OR HOLD CUSTOMER HARMLESS FOR ANY CLAIM IF: (A) CUSTOMER MADE MODIFICATIONS TO THE SOFTWARE OR MATERIALS OR PORTIONS THEREOF; (B) SUCH CLAIM WOULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED BY USE OF THE THEN CURRENT RELEASE OF THE SOFTWARE MADE AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMER; (C) CUSTOMER CONTINUED ITS ALLEGEDLY INFRINGING ACTIVITY AFTER BEING PROVIDED WITH MODIFICATIONS THAT WOULD HAVE AVOIDED THE ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT; OR (D) SUCH CLAIM IS BASED ON CUSTOMER’S OUTPUT.
c) IF LICENSOR DEFENDS OR SETTLES AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ARISING UNDER SECTION 7.A ABOVE, LICENSOR’S LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY (IN ADDITION TO THE “INDEMNITY”) SHALL BE FOR LICENSOR AT ITS OWN EXPENSE, TO EITHER (A) REPAIR, REPLACE OR MODIFY THE AFFECTED SOFTWARE OR RE-PERFORM THE AFFECTED CONSULTING SERVICES OR (B) ALTERNATIVELY, PROCURE FOR CUSTOMER THE RIGHT TO CONTINUE TO USE THE AFFECTED SOFTWARE OR MATERIALS.  IF THE FOREGOING REMEDIES ARE NOT COMMERCIALLY FEASIBLE (IN THE REASONABLE OPINION OF LICENSOR), LICENSOR MAY (I) CANCEL THE APPLICABLE ORDER FORM AND, AS APPLICABLE, FOR THE AFFECTED SOFTWARE REFUND THE LICENSE FEES AND ANY UNEARNED MAINTENANCE FEES PAID TO LICENSOR BY CUSTOMER FOR THE AFFECTED SOFTWARE, OR (II) FOR CONSULTING SERVICES REFUND ALL AMOUNTS PAID TO LICENSOR BY CUSTOMER FOR THE AFFECTED CONSULTING SERVICES.

b) Licensor is not responsible for any claimed breach of any warranty caused by:

c) If the Licensor Software does not perform as warranted during the Warranty Period, Licensor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to correct Errors. Customer shall promptly notify Licensor in writing of its claim within the Software Warranty Period.  Provided that such claim is determined by Licensor to be Licensor’s responsibility, as Customer’s exclusive remedy for any warranty claim, Licensor shall, within 30 days of its receipt of Customer’s written notice, (i) correct such Error; (ii) provide Customer with a plan reasonably acceptable to Customer for correcting the Error, or (iii) if neither (i) nor (ii) can be accomplished with reasonable commercial efforts from Licensor, then Licensor may terminate the affected Licensor Software license and issue Customer a refund of the license fees paid for the affected Licensor Software. The preceding warranty cure constitutes Licensor’s entire liability and Customer’s exclusive remedy for Licensor’s breach of the warranty stated herein. 
d) EXCEPT AS STATED ABOVE, LICENSOR, ITS LICENSORS, WEBHOST, DATACENTER AND SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING (i) ANY WARRANTY THAT ANY SOFTWARE, MATERIALS OR SERVICES ARE ERROR-FREE, ACCURATE OR RELIABLE OR WILL OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR THAT ALL ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED OR WILL COMPLY WITH ANY LAW, RULE OR REGULATION (ii) ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT AND (iii) ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING FROM STATUTE, COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE.

CUSTOMER ASSUMES ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SELECTION OF THE SOFTWARE AND OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER TO ACHIEVE CUSTOMER’S INTENDED RESULTS. EXCEPT FOR THE EXCLUDED MATTERS, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO THE OTHER FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR AS A RESULT OF THE AGREEMENT EXCEED THE GREATER OF 1,000,000 USD OR THE FEES PAID BY CUSTOMER TO LICENSOR UNDER THE APPLICABLE ORDER FORM.

c) This Agreement does not create an agency or consignment relationship, and neither party is a partner, employee, agent or joint venture partner of, or with, the other.

e) Licensor may designate any agent or subcontractor to perform such tasks and functions to complete any services covered under this Agreement, provided, however, that Licensor shall remain responsible for performance of its duties under the terms of this Agreement.
f) During the term of any Order Form and for a period of one year following termination of an Order Form, Licensor and its independent auditors, at Licensor's expense, may audit Customer‘s compliance with this Agreement upon 10 days’ notice and at reasonable times and report any results to Licensor’s licensors.

If the audit reveals any noncompliance, Customer shall reimburse Licensor for the reasonable costs and expenses of the audit (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees), and Customer shall promptly cure any such noncompliance; provided, however, that the obligations under this section do not constitute a waiver of Licensor’s termination rights and do not affect Licensor’s right to payment for Software or Materials related to usage in excess of the Number of Units.

i) Performance under the Agreement will be postponed automatically if a party is prevented from performing by any act of or failure to act by the other party.

j) Except for an assignment, in whole or part, by Licensor to an Affiliate, neither party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, and/or any of its rights and/or obligations without the prior written consent of the other party, which will not be unreasonably withheld.

m) If Customer is entering into the Agreement from a European Union member country, Norway, Switzerland, Japan, India or Australia, then the Agreement is governed by the laws of Ireland and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland.

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to this Agreement.
n) If any sentence, clause, or other provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under applicable law, including, but not limited to, any limitation of liability, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining clauses and provisions are not affected or impaired. The parties shall interpret the affected provision in a manner that renders it enforceable while attempting to closely approximate the intent and the economic effect of the affected provision.
o) If any terms and conditions of the Master Terms conflict with the Documentation, then such license requirements or notices pertaining to Third Party Software included with the Software will control.

It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, agreements, or understandings between the parties relating to its subject matter. No modification to the Agreement will be binding unless in writing and signed by each party, except in the case of an Order Form where Licensor’s acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on Licensor’s initial delivery of products or services under the Order Form.
