     * The Query repo object has a "sql" field which contains the actual query to run.
     * It was mapped to a varchar, which has lower limits on some platforms (looking at you, Oracle).
     * Domain queries were getting rather huge and exceeding the 3600-char limit, so we did compression and Base64 encoding.
     * At the time, the only encoder built in was sun.misc.Base64Encoder, which wasn't "official".
     * To support Java 9, we needed to get rid of these kinds of dependencies, and Java 8 added public Base64 encoding.
     * However, there are various flavors; MIME encoding has line breaks, and "basic" does not.
     * The old Base64Encoder was really a MIME encoder and we picked a new encoder that doesn't like the line feeds.
     * Here we are trying to read a query encoded with the old code to make sure it works.
