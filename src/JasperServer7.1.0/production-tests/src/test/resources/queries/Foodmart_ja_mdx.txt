select {[Measures].[Unit Sales???], [Measures].[Store Cost???], [Measures].[Store Sales???]} ON COLUMNS,
  Hierarchize(Union(Crossjoin({[Promotion Media???].[All Media???]}, {[Product???].[All Products???]}),
Crossjoin({[Promotion Media???].[All Media???]}, [Product???].[All Products???].Children))) ON ROWS
