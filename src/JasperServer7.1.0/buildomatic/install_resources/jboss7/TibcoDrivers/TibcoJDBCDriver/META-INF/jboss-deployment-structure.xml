            [dlitvak] Jboss7 seems to read jars from vfs (virtual) directory: a security mechanism?
            Jboss's classloader assigns vfs location to CodeSource object of the loaded jar classes.
            In order to assign the class object physical deployment module location, wwe found it necessary to introduce this file with
            additional resource roots marked with use-physical-code-source="true" (issue 26780)
