.overrides_custom css

(Accessible Version)

Place styles for simple UI customization in this file.

This file is loaded after all other CSS, so selectors here will win in case of
conflicts with the default rules.

Using this file for customizations is the method most likely to conserve your
customizations even if markup changes occur in future product releases.

Extensive customizations may be easier to implement by replacing one or more of
the standard theme files in your custom theme folder.  However, if future
product releases place styles for new markup components into the files you have
replaced, your theme will not have these new styles, and therefore will not
display the new components correctly.

/* Standard Navigation toggle
 * The JavaScript logic that enabled accessible navigation of JRS is enabled by
 * detecting the existance of the class ".js-accessibility-enabled".  The class
 * defines a single rule to avoid being dropped or optimized out, but is not
 * applied to any element in the DOM.
 *
 * To disable the system, and test visual effects only, comment out this
 * definition.

/* Standard Navigation classes and styles
 *
 * The Standard Navigation accessibility system (StdNav) provides some special
 * CSS class to augment the normal ":focus" pseudoclass available to track
 * browser focus.  By default, only the familiar dashed-line ":focus" indicator
 * is used.  This focus indication is as per W3C recommendations, and is
 * generally expected by users.
 *
 * However, additional classes are available as well, and are described below.
 * If you wish to use these, you should start by using and modifying the "Easy
 * Access" theme, or a copy of it.
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * superfocus   A class given to exactly one element in the page at all times
 *              to indicate which major UI region is the user's current "area
 *              of interest".  This will generally either be, or contain, the
 *              browser focus, but will generally be broader than browser
 *              focus.  Jaspersoft extension.
 *
 * :focus       The normal browser focus metaclass.  However, for reasons of
 *              accessibility and navigation, be aware that focus can and will
 *              be set on items that TEMPORARILY have a valid tabindex, but
 *              will not necessarily retain it after navigation (such as an
 *              individual table cell).  Note that when a user is using pure
 *              keyboard navigation, there will be times when NO element in the
 *              page has :focus because the user is tabbing through browser
 *              toolbars, etc.  For screen readers, this is the element whose
 *              content we want to be read, and whose navigation details we
 *              expect to be relayed.
 *
 * subfocus     Fine navigation focus.  Normally, this is applied to the same
 *              element as :focus, but if it is necessary to indicate position
 *              within the child subdom of an element without moving browser
 *              focus to those elements, subfocus may be changed instead.  In
 *              any case, subfocus must always be set correctly, even if it
 *              is simply to the same element that has :focus.  Jaspersoft
 *              extension.
 *
 * ghostfocus - Whenever a major UI region has superfocus, either it or a child
 *              element must have browser TAB focus and StdNav subfocus.  When
 *              superfocus moves to another major UI region-- for example, when
 *              the user presses TAB-- subfocus is replaced by ghostfocus in
 *              the de-focused region.  Likewise, if an element in the newly
 *              superfocused region has ghostfocus, that is replaced by
 *              subfocus.  Finally, the browser is explicitly focused to the
 *              new subfocus (the old ghostfocus, if there was one, or a
 *              sensible default for the region).  This functionality allows a
 *              user to tab back and force between grids, tables, lists, and
 *              other complex controls without losing their place.  Jaspersoft
 *              extension, and not in use by all control types.

/* NOTE: Form controls and CSS are not always the best of friends.  Applying
 * global styles can cause problems when the rules fall through to form
 * controls, because even a simple background color change can cause browsers
 * to drop ALL of the default styling for the control, radically changing its
 * appearance.  In particular, Firefox has serious issues with this with respect
 * to "select" (dropdown/droplist) controls.
 *
 * This can be gotten around using the :not CSS selector, HOWEVER, be aware that
 * IE8 does not support ":not".  Conveniently, though, it also doesn't have such
 * big issues with CSS styles messing up form controls.
