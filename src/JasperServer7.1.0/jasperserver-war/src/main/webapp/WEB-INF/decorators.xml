    <!--
    There are various ways to get SiteMesh to choose a decorator, The usual
    way is to take the URL and match a pattern.

    Note that in JasperIntelligence, the pattern has no effect. Our JSPs will appear to
    SiteMesh like /WEB-INF/jsp/xxx.jsp, regardless of the original URL.
    This is due to Spring MVC and Spring Web Flow.

    One way to get a different decorator for a given page is to set a META tag in the HTML
    header generated by the JSP, ie.

    <html>
    <head>
      <title>VIEW&nbsp;REPORT&nbsp;PAGE&nbsp;</title>
      <meta name="pageHeading" content="VIEW REPORT">
      <META name="decorator" content="myDifferentDecorator"/>
    </head>
    -->

    <!--<decorator name="main" page="main_Old.jsp">-->
        <!--<pattern>/*</pattern>-->
    <!--</decorator>-->

    <!--new decorator for visual framework-->
    <decorator name="sample" page="main.jsp">
        <pattern>/*</pattern>
    </decorator>

    <decorator name="empty" page="emptyDecorator.jsp"/>

</decorators>
