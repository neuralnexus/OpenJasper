COMMITTER Text File
-------------------

This file assists with locking trunk or branch code. 

An svn property can be set on this file. 

A pre-commit hook script on the server looks for the existence
of the property js-committer set on this file. 

The script reads the value of the js-committer property and 
expects the svn user account name of a user allowed to commit. 

  svn propset <prop> <value> COMMITTER

  svn propdel <prop> COMMITTER

WARNING: The js-committer property is managed by the Dev-Build Team 
         and/or by a Subversion Administrator.
