/**
 * Model extended from ScalableListModel which allows to work with selection.
 * It holds selection as an object hash
 *
 * Model API (in addition to ScalableListModel API):
 *      addValueToSelection         - adds one value to selection and triggers "selection:add" event
 *      addRangeToSelection         - adds range from last adding of single selection to passed
 *                                    index and triggers "selection:addRange"
 *      removeValueFromSelection    - removes value from selection and triggers "selection:remove"
 *      toggleSelection             - toggles selection and triggers appropriate event
 *      selectionContains           - return true if value is selected and false otherwise
 *      clearSelection              - clear selection and trigger "selection:clear" event
 *      getSelection                - returns current selection as sparse array
 *      select                      - select passed values
 *      selectAll                   - select all values
 *      invertSelection             - inverts selection
 *
 * this Model implementation looks for following additional options in hash provided to constructor:
 *      selection       - initial selection
