-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Introduction

JasperReports Server Community Project is a high-performance,
standalone and embeddable Business Intelligence (BI) platform 
that provides rich reporting capabilities. In addition, 
Jaspersoft OLAP provides data analysis running on the same 
shared BI platform. 

These release notes describe the installation and available 
functionality at a high level; for details, please refer to the 
documentation, which is available at <js-install>/docs after 
installation. In particular, refer to the Installation Guide for 
instructions about running the installer, creating and updating 
the database, deploying the WAR file, and to the Upgrade Guide 
for details on migrating from previous versions.

Note: JasperReports Server is governed by a License Agreement,
the text of which is found at <js-install>/license.txt. Please 
read it before you login to JasperReports Server for the first 
time. If you installed the server using the installer binary 
(rather than deploying a WAR file), you have already agreed to 
this license.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. What's New

JasperReports Server 5.6 includes these improvements:

 * Documentation Improvements - We have reorganized some of
   our product documentation for ease of use. In previous 
   releases, the installation guide included information about 
   upgrade. In this release, the installation guide describes 
   new installations only; for information about upgrading from 
   previous versions or from other editions of the product, 
   please refer to the new JasperReports Server Upgrade Guide.

 * Improved Performance - Performance has been improved under 
   certain conditions, such as:
   - When running and viewing reports in JasperReoprts Server.
   - When using REST web services for resources and permissions
     in JasperReoprts Server.
   - When designing reports in Jaspersoft Studio.
 
 * Support for external pre-authentication - The external 
   authentication API now supports direct access to 
   JasperReports Server for users who authenticate by passing an 
   authentication token in a URL or HTTP header. For more 
   information, refer to the Jaspersoft External Authentication 
   Cookbook.
   
 * Report Viewer improvements - Several new features have been
   added to the report viewer, including the ability to magnify
   the report, the ability to search within the report's 
   content, and a table of contents for reports where bookmarks 
   are defined.
 
 * OLAP Engine Upgrade - The engine underlying Jaspersoft OLAP
   has been updated. The new version of Mondrian used by 
   Jaspersoft is 3.6. This version fixes a number of defects
   and exposes new configuration properties. For more 
   information, refer to the Jaspersoft OLAP User Guide.
   
 * Improved MDX Support in Jaspersoft Studio - Jaspersoft Studio
   has improved support for MDX data sources, including a 
   new mapping tool that allows you to more easily manage and 
   work with your data.
 
 * Platform Support - Jaspersoft has added support for the 
   following third-part software:
   - Operating Systems:
     - Fedora 18
     - Ubuntu 12
   - Web Browser:
     - Internet Explorer 11
  
 * Support for Spring 3.1.4. Please note that only Version 
    2.0.7 of Spring Security is supported.
  
 * In this release, Jaspersoft only provides JDBC drivers for 
   these data source types:
   - PostgreSQL
   - MySQL
   
   For other data source types, you must obtain the drivers 
   separately and install them in our products. For more 
   information, refer to the JasperReports Server Administrator
   Guide.


JasperReports Server 5.5 added these improvements:
 
 * Updated Scheduling User Interface - The Report Scheduler now
   allows you to disable scheduled jobs (without deleting them)
   and provides more control over the time and recurrence of your
   scheduled jobs. The scheduler also offers new output options 
   to FTP server and the host file system; more options to embed
   report output as HTML in an email body or as ZIP file 
   attachments; and more control over success and failure 
   notifications.
   
 * Import/Export Web UI - JasperReports Server can now to import 
   or export repository objects from the web UI. Login as a user 
   with ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR and click Manage > Server Settings to 
   import a catalog or export the entire repository. You can 
   export folders and individual resources from the Repository 
   page. 
 
 * Clustering Session Replication - To enable high availability, 
   JasperReports Server now supports limited session replication
   in cluster environments. In case of node failure, users' 
   sessions can resume automatically on another node of the 
   cluster. However, reports and OLAP views cannot be replicated,
   so the user must launch those again in the event that a node 
   fails.
   
   Note that high-availability is only supported when the server
   is hosted by Tomcat.
 
 * OLAP improvements - Jaspersoft's support of XML/A has been
   enhanced with these new features:
   - XML/A caching - XML/A caching has been optimized to improve
     performance for XML/A connections.
   - Test Connection - When defining XML/A connections, users
     can now test the connection directly on the current page using
     the new Test Connection button.
 
 * Password encryption - To prevent any database passwords from 
   appearing in installation scripts, configuration files, or 
   exported data sources, the installer and server can now encrypt 
   these passwords. When configured, administrators must enter a 
   master password to import or export resources from the server.

 * REST v2 web services - Jaspersoft continues to expand and 
   improve the functionality of the REST web services. This API 
   allows client applications to interact with most features of 
   the server over HTTP using standard XML and JSON objects. 
   With the completion of the v2 REST API, Jaspersoft announces 
   the deprecation of the original REST API and the end-of-life 
   of the SOAP services. While these services will remain 
   available in the server for the time being, Jaspersoft 
   recommends that you migrate your integration to the latest 
   API available: Jaspersoft v2 REST API.

 * Installation Components - The binary installer has been upgraded 
   to provide Tomcat 7.0 as the default version bundled with the 
   installer. In addition, the default Java version bundled with the 
   installer has been upgraded to Java 7. 
   
 * Certifications: With this release, JasperReports Server is 
   certified with the following third-party software:
   
   * Operating system:
     * CentOS 6.4
     * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4
     * Mac OSX 10.8 (Mountain Lion)
   
   * Repository host RDBMS:
     * MySQL 5.6
   
   * Data source:
     * Greenplum 4.2.3
     * MySQL 5.6
   

JasperReports Server 5.2 was a maintenance release focused on 
software quality and user experience improvements. In addition to 
defect fixes, it included these improvements:

 * Time Series Charts - Time series charts are now supported in 
   iReport and Jaspersoft Studio. These intelligent charts 
   automatically scale their x-axis intervals and skip missing 
   values in interval data.
 
 * REST v2 web services - Jaspersoft continues to expand and 
   improve the functionality of the REST web services. This 
   API allows client applications to interact with most 
   features of the server over HTTP using standard XML and JSON 
   objects. In this release, REST v2 includes support for 
   repository permissions. 
   
 * MariaDB JDBC Client Library - Jaspersoft now distributes the 
   open source MariaDB JDBC Client Library to provide JDBC 
   connectivity to compatible data sources, such as MariaDB and 
   MySQL. Users who previously had to download and install a 
   JDBC driver for these types of data sources can now access 
   them from the server without having to install a third-party 
   driver.
   

JasperReports Server 5.1 was a maintenance release focused on 
software quality and user experience improvements. It also 
included these improvements:

 * A new translation of the web UI text into Brazilian 
   Portuguese.

 * Improved Single Sign-on (SSO) Support - A new customizable 
   bean API leverages the Spring Security framework to simplify 
   the creation and configuration of external authentication for 
   JasperReports Server. To configure this new API, create a 
   custom applicationContext file and place it in the WEB-INF 
   directory. Sample files for LDAP and CAS are included in the 
   standard distribution.
  
 * Improved Support for JDBC Data Sources - Jaspersoft has made
   the server's JDBC data sources easier to manage. In 
   particular, users can add new drivers through the web UI. 

 * Installation Improvements - The binary installer now sports 
   an improved user experience, including:
   - Express and Custom Install options. The Express option lets  
     you perform a full component install with a single click.
   - Disk space checks and display of required space for a full 
     installation.     
   - Smaller installation footprint. The installer no longer 
     includes iReport; please install this desktop client tool 
     separately.
 

 JasperReports Server 5.0 included these improvements:
    
 *  Relative Date Handling. Reports and dashboards now provide
    the ability to specify relative dates in input controls.
    For example, you could enter WEEK - 1 in a Start Date input 
    control to retrieve all the data for the last seven days. 
    Supported keywords in this release are DAY, WEEK, MONTH,
    QUARTER, SEMI (that is, half-year), and YEAR.

  * Report Viewer Improvements - The report viewer now offers 
    conditional formatting of table fields and an improved UI. 

  * Extended XML/A support - JasperReports Server can now connect 
    to Microsoft SQL Server Analytic Services to populate views 
    and reports with multi-dimensional OLAP data. For 
    configuration details, refer to the Jaspersoft OLAP User Guide.

  * Component upgrades - Jaspersoft has upgraded some third 
    party components of the server. Groovy 2.0 is a more powerful 
    scripting language with better type checking and static 
    compilation. EHCache provides the ability to measure
    memory usage and enforce limits on total memory usage.

  * User profile attributes - JasperReports Server now provides 
    access to user's profile attributes through the web UI's 
    Manage > Users page.
    
  * PHP SDK - This new package lets users interact with 
    JasperReports Server using PHP. A set of PHP classes wrap the 
    server's web services REST API with easy to use business 
    logic so that you can focus on your PHP application rather 
    than its interactions with the server.

Changes to OLAP engine: Due to a change between versions of the 
OLAP engine, if you use Jaspersoft OLAPs XML/A functionality to 
connect to a remote JasperReports Servers XML/A sources, you must 
take additional steps to complete your upgrade to 5.6.

6.4.2 Additional Information on Planning for Upgrade

For additional information on planning for your upgrade
please see Appendix A "Planning Your Upgrade" in the 
JasperReports Server Upgrade Guide.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
7. Security Fixes 

* 36569: SECURITY - CVE-2014-0050
  Specially crafted input can allow a DoS attack with old versions
  of the FileUpload component. Upgraded to Apache Commons FileUpload 
  component version 1.3.1 which has a security fix that addresses 
  this security issue. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------
8. Known Issues

* 21798: Performance in Internet Explorer. When
  JasperReports Server is accessed through Microsoft
  Internet Explorer 8, performance may be impaired. Jaspersoft 
  recommends version 9, 10, or 11 of Internet Explorer.
  Internet Explorer users should also note that Jaspersoft no 
  longer certifies IE7.

  For more information about these support level definitions, 
  please see the Platform Support document available from the 
  Support Portal.
  
* 32159: When the 64-bit JasperReports Server binary installer 
  is run in some versions of Mac OSX (including Mac OSX 10.8.3), 
  and you select the option to install the bundled PostgreSQL, 
  an error appears if PostgreSQL 9.1 is already installed. The 
  message indicates that the process couldn't create a shared 
  memory segment, and directs you to further information in the 
  PostgreSQL documentation. For example, see 
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/kernel-resources.html, 
  which describes a workaround for the problem. Jaspersoft has 
  determined that this workaround can resolve the issue in the 
  JasperReports Server installer.

  Since the problem originates in the PostgreSQL installer, 
  Jaspersoft has no plans for its resolution.
   
* 32168: Though Jaspersoft does not strictly support the 
  practice, in previous versions of JasperReports Server, it 
  was possible to create a clone install in JBoss by copying an 
  existing JasperReports Server WAR file and deploying it to a 
  new JBoss instance. With 5.1, Jaspersoft supports JBoss 
  AS7/EAP6, but has uncovered issues with clone installs. For 
  more information, refer to http://tinyurl.com/cv6ta2l.

* 35986 - If you use Jaspersoft OLAP's XML/A functionality to 
   connect to a remote JasperReports Server's XML/A sources, you 
   must take additional steps to complete your upgrade.  You 
   must redefine your XML/A connections to specify the 
   connection string in  a new way. For example, in previous 
   versions, the Foodmart XML/A connection specified: 
   
   Provider=Mondrian;DataSource=Foodmart
   
   In the new version, the DataSource portion of the 
   connection string is always JRS when the remote provider
   is JasperReports Server. For example:
   
   Provider=Mondrian;DataSource=JRS

 
Jaspersoft considers this defect, which was listed in the release
notes of previous versions, to be obsolete:

* 10254 (obsolete): This defect concerned  incompatible versions
  of JFreeCharts used by another application that retrieved 
  JasperPrint objects through JasperReports Server's  web 
  services. If your client application used an earlier version 
  of JFreeCharts, it could crash when it tried to retrieve a 
  report that included a chart. Since Jaspersoft has not changed 
  JFreeCharts versions since upgrading to 1.0.12, we consider 
  this issue obsolete. To work around the issue, upgrade your 
  client application to use JFreeCharts version 1.0.12.
 
 
These defects, which were listed in the release notes of previous
versions, have been fixed in JasperReports Server 5.1:

* 24226: (fixed) If the JasperReports Server repository was 
  hosted by PostgreSQL, your users' names were case-sensitive. 
  The server now treats users' names case-insensitively. 

* 24762: (fixed) Under certain circumstances when installing on a 
  Windows 7 system, the installer failed with an error in 
  initdb.exe. The root of the problem, which originates in a 
  problem between Microsoft Windows and PostgreSQL, is the use 
  of a symbolic link in the path to the installation directory. 
  Jaspersoft has implemented a new feature that prevents this 
  failure.

* 25644: (fixed) The js-upgrade-newdb.bat/sh upgrade script used 
  during upgrades set the passwords for the superuser and 
  jasperadmin back to their default values. The script has been 
  corrected and the passwords are no longer reset.

* 28516: (fixed) JasperReports Server supports both IE8 and IE9. 
  However, supporting both in previous versions of the server 
  involved forcing IE9 to mimic IE8. In this version of the
  server, IE9 is no longer forced to mimic IE8. The workaround
  needed in previous versions (the addition of a meta tag to 
  any page that used an iframe to embed the server's pages) is 
  no longer required.

* 30176: (fixed) In certain configurations, JasperReports Server 
  returned an exception when users clicked the Change Data Cube 
  button in an OLAP view. Jaspersoft changed the way the server 
  calls the Xalan transformation factory, and the exception no 
  longer occurs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
10. End of Support Notices

Jaspersoft is in the process of ending support for several 
technologies:

* JasperReports Server no longer supports JDK 1.5.
  
* Jaspersoft is deprecating its Open Flash 
  functionality in favor of HTML5 solutions. In particular, the 
  Flash samples that shipped with previous versions of the 
  server are no longer provided. Also note that the Flash 
  export option has been removed from the report viewer. If you 
  want to re-enable this ability, you can uncomment the exporter
  in a configuration file. 

  To do so, open the WEB-INF/flows/viewReportBeans.xml file and  
  uncomment this line:
  <entry key="swf" value-ref="swfExporterConfiguration"/>
  
* With the completion of the v2 REST API, Jaspersoft announces 
  the deprecation of the original REST API and the end-of-life 
  of the SOAP services. While these services will remain 
  available in the server for the time being, Jaspersoft 
  recommends that you migrate your integration to the latest 
  API available: Jaspersoft v2 REST API.
  
* For Mac OSX, Jaspersoft no longer supports:
  * The 32 bit version of Apple OSX 
  * Apple OSX 10.5  

* With the general availability of the commercial edition of 
  Jaspersoft Studio, Jaspersoft announced that iReport is 
  now in maintenance mode. We recommend that you migrate to
  Jaspersoft Studio, which offers improvements beyond what is 
  available in iReport.

* With the addition of more advanced interactive behavior in the 
  report viewer, JasperReports Server no longer supports 
  interactivity in the xhtml report exporter. If you want 
  your reports to be interactive when viewed in the server, 
  you must use the default report exporter (html2). For more 
  information, see the JasperReports Server Administrator Guide.

* In April 2014, Microsoft ended support for its Windows XP
  operating system. For more information, see:
  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/xp/end-of-xp-support.aspx
