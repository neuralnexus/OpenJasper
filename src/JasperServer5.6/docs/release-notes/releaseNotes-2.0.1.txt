1. Introduction

JasperServer is specifically designed to provide a web 
application around JasperReports, the most popular open
source reporting solution. Continuing the philosophy of
JasperReports, JasperServer provides a managed, stand-alone
web reporting environment. You can also embed JasperServer
in existing Java web applications and services and to a
variety of technologies, including the LAMP stack. By
focusing on a clean business API and using an advanced
inversion of control architecture, JasperServer
can be easily integrated and customized for your needs. 

JasperServer provides the ability to define and maintain
JasperReports in a web application and web services 
environment. An extensible metadata repository defines 
all resources needed to run JasperReports in a secure
environment. You can define report parameters to prompt
users for required input when reports are run.

6. Known Issues

* a bug was reported with mondrian-2.3: 
  if a value for a member is null, the 
  data for views including that member
  may be incorrect.  This is not common,
  the workaround is to ensure member
  names are not null.
