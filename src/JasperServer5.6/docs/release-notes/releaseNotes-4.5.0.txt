-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Introduction

JasperReports Server Community Project is a high-performance,
standalone and embeddable Business Intelligence (BI) platform 
that provides rich reporting capabilities. In addition, 
Jaspersoft OLAP provides data analysis running on the same 
shared BI platform. 

These release notes describe the installation and available 
functionality at a high level; for details, please refer to the 
documentation, which is available at <js-install>/docs after 
installation. In particular, refer to the Installation Guide for 
instructions about running the installer, creating and updating 
the database, deploying the WAR file, and upgrading from 
previous versions.

Note: JasperReports Server is governed by a License Agreement,
the text of which is found at <js-install>/license.txt. Please 
read it before you login to JasperReports Server for the first 
time. If you installed the server using the installer binary 
(rather than deploying a WAR file), you have already agreed to 
this license.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. What's New

JasperReports Server 4.5.0 now includes the following:

  * Evaluation Central - Jaspersoft is pleased to provide this
    resource as a gateway to new users exploring the Jaspersoft
    BI Suite. Point your browser to
    http://www.jaspersoft.com/getting-started for tools,
    documentation, and support to evaluate our solutions. This
    one-stop shop helps you complete your evaluation and engage
    with the Jaspersoft team when you need us. Note that this 
    location covers both Community and Commercial features. 

  * Improved Report Viewer:

    * Interactivity - Reports created with JRXML table components
      are now interactive directly in the server's Report Viewer.
      Users can sort the table by clicking one or more column
      names and filter displayed rows by right-clicking the
      column name, selecting an operator, and entering a value.

    * Excel output format - New export options in the Report
      Viewer produce true single-page spreadsheet output in Excel
      and XLSX format. These options run the report again to
      seamlessly fill tables and crosstabs, so that the spread-
      sheet is ready for further data manipulation in Excel. The
      previous Excel and XLSX options are still available with
      the Paginated label. The paginated options do not run the
      report again (faster), but may contain page artifacts such
      as column or row breaks.

    * Interface - The Report Viewer has been improved to show the
      report name at the top and move pagination controls above
      the report contents.

  * Web Services REST API - In this release, new REST 
    (Representational State Transfer) web services provide 
    complete access to repository resources and server 
    administration. Remote applications can now manage users 
    and roles through RESTful methods. In addition, the REST 
    methods are enhanced to interact with scheduled jobs.

  * Security - JasperReports Server now has enterprise-grade
    security through the integration of a comprehensive security
    framework. This new security framework protects the server
    against common security threats. Customers can configure the
    security settings (switch on/off or change the security
    rules) based on their perceived threat level.

  * Database Server Support - JasperReports Server now supports
    MySQL 5.5 as an RDBMS host for the repository database. You
    must provide the required JDBC driver for this platform.
    Refer to the Installation Guide for details.

  * Code compilation support for Java 1.6. With this release, 
    JasperReports Server no longer supports Java 1.5. This means 
    that all Java 1.6 code syntax is now fully supported.

  * Fix to issue found in 4.2.1 where the View > Repository
    context menu was missing the Add Resource > File option. 
    The menu option has been restored. 

JasperReports Server 4.2.1 added these improvements:

  * iPad Support - JasperReports Server's web application now
    supports the Apple iPad running the Safari browser. In 
    this release, the server supports viewing content (such as
    browsing the repository, running and copying reports, and 
    viewing dashboards) and creating Ad Hoc reports. 
 
  * Interactive HTML reports - Using JasperReports Server, you
    can now publish reports that allow users to sort or filter 
    in the browser. Users click to modify these reports 
    on-the-fly. Interactivity is available for all reports 
    that use the table component. 

  * New HTML Output - The server includes a new XHTML exporter
    that is less strict with regard to overlapping HTML
    elements. You can specify whether the server uses the
    pre-existing HTML exporter or the new XHTML exporter. If
    you want your table component reports to be interactive,
    JasperReports Server must use the XHTML exporter.
    
  * REST API - JasperReports Server now includes web services
    based on the REST style of architecture. In this release, 
    the RESTful services allow you to access repository 
    functionality, such as getting, putting, posting, and 
    deleting objects in the repository. 

  * Database Server Support:
  
    * PostgreSQL - The bundled database installed by default with
      JasperReports Server has changed from MySQL to PostgreSQL
      9.0.4. JasperReports Server continues to support a wide
      range of databases, including MySQL. MySQL users can set up
      JasperReports Server during installation to connect to their
      existing MySQL database. 

      In earlier releases, Jaspersoft also provided and installed
      the driver for the MySQL database. The installer no longer
      provides this driver. MySQL 5.1 users can download the JDBC
      driver, mysql-connector-java-5.1.17-bin.jar, from this web
      site: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

    * An existing (unbundled) PostgreSQL instance can be 
      located on a remote host. You need to enable remote 
      connections in the PostgreSQL configuration. See the 
      JasperReports Server Installation Guide for more 
      information. 

    * JasperReports Server now supports MySQL 5.5 as a data
      source. Note that MySQL 5.5 was not supported by 4.2.1 as 
      a repository database.
      
  * Application Server Support - JasperReports Server now 
    supports Tomcat 7.0, and recommends version 7.0.19 or later.

  * Updated versions of JasperReports Library and iReport 
    Designer - JasperReports Server 4.2.1 includes JasperReports 
    Library and iReport Designer 4.2.1, which include support for 
    PDF/A compliant PDF export, and the ability to apply 
    interactivity (sorting or filtering) to report components.

JasperReports Server 4.1 added these improvements:

  * Support for five additional languages - In this release, we 
    added language resource bundles for Chinese, French, German, 
    Japanese, and Spanish. This is in addition to the default 
    English language bundles.

  * Support for 64 bit Installers - You can now download either 
    32 bit or 64 bit installers. The 64 bit installers contain 
    a 64 bit version of Java 6 and a 64 bit version of PostgreSQL 
    5.1 as bundled components. The 64 bit Java 6 JVM is known to 
    run JasperReports Server with greater speed and performance. 

  * Localization of Input Controls - In previous releases, the 
    labels applied to a report's input controls could only 
    support a single language. Now, you can supply resource 
    bundles that define the input control's labels in various 
    languages. In addition, if the input control relies on a 
    fixed list of values, the list of values can also support 
    multiple languages. For more information, refer to the 
    JasperReports Server Community Project User Guide.

  * Templates. Some changes have been made to the server's UI 
    components:
     
    * In order to support certain application servers, some 
      JSP files (in /templates) have been renamed so that
      the names do not include the hash mark (#). These pages
      represent all types of dialogs (such as the About
      dialog and the Save As dialog), as opposed to generic
      components, such as page.jsp or container.jsp. All
      references to these JSPs in the other pages have also
      been updated.
       
    * In the file system of the server's host, the templates 
      folder has been moved from:
        jasperserver/WEB-INF/jsp/modules/templates/ 
          to 
        jasperserver/WEB-INF/jsp/templates/ 
         
      That is, it has been moved up one level.
      
 JasperReports Server 4.0 added these improvements:
 
   * Product Naming. Several changes have been made to  
     Jaspersoft's product names; in particular: 
     * The former "JasperServer" is called "JasperReports Server" 
     * The former "JasperAnalysis" is called "Jaspersoft OLAP" 
   
   These changes are reflected by our products, documentation, 
   and web content. 
   
   * Improved User Interface. The usability and look and feel of 
     the JasperReports Server web user interface has been 
     improved to simplify many user tasks and to make it more 
     visually appealing. The underlying framework introduced as 
     part of this feature (Jaspersoft Interface Framework (JIF)) 
     allows the application's look and feel to be modified more 
     quickly and easily than in previous releases. Note that some 
     types of customization may need to be implemented in a 
     different way in this version than in previous versions.
 
   * Application Themes. JasperReports Server now supports the 
     ability to define themes that control the web interface's
     look and feel. These themes take advantage of JIF to let 
     users define Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), images, and other 
     graphical elements of the application. Themes can be stored in 
     the repository and can be updated without the need to restart 
     the server. 
 
   * Macintosh Installer Support. This release includes a new 
     installer for Macintosh computers. For more information, 
     refer to the Installation Notes section of this doc and to
     the JasperReports Server Installation Guide. 
     
   * Installer Components Updated. The JasperReports Server
     installers have been updated to provide more current 
     applications:
     * Tomcat has been updated from 5.5 to 6.0. 
     * MySQL has been updated from 5.0 to 5.1. 
     * Java has been updated from 1.5 to 1.6.
     
   * Buildomatic Ant Install Scripts Updated. In addition to the 
     binary installers (Windows, Linux, and Mac) the buildomatic 
     installation files have been upgraded with auto-install and
     auto-upgrade batch/shell scripts. Now a single properties 
     file and a single script execution complete most steps for 
     installing or upgrading the server.
 
   * Updated OLAP Engine. This release includes a new version of 
     Mondrian, the OLAP engine underlying Jaspersoft OLAP. The 
     new version of Mondrian is 3.2.0. Major improvements 
     include:
     
      * Improved native performance
      * olap4j drill through support
      * Improved XML/A support
      * Greenplum Dialect
      * Improved parameter support
 
   * Execute-only Permission. A new level of access has been added 
     for repository objects. Execute-only permission gives 
     administrators finer control over what users see in the 
     repository. As in a file system, execute-only permission 
     allows regular users to access resources at run-time but 
     not browse or search for them in the repository. For example, 
     placing data sources in an execute-only folder allows users  
     to run reports and access the data, but hides the data 
     sources from the end user. Administrators can use the
     execute-only permission to hide supporting resources so that 
     end-users interact with only reports, dashboards, and OLAP 
     views in the repository. 
 
   * Log Settings Page. The new log settings page, accessible to 
     administrators by clicking Manage > Log Settings, lets you
     change the  logging levels without restarting JasperReports
     Server.
     
   * New JasperReports version 4.0.0 is included in JasperReports 
     Server. A new CSV query executer is added to simplify the
     configuring of CSV data sources. Also, a new CSV metadata
     exporter has been added to better control the CSV export. 
     The version of iReport included here has also been updated
     to 4.0.0.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
6. Upgrade Notes

You can upgrade directly to 4.5 if your instance is one of the
following:

  * 3.7
  * 3.7.1
  * 4.0
  * 4.1
  * 4.2.1

To upgrade, start with the WAR File Distribution ZIP
(jasperreports-server-cp-4.5.0-bin.zip). It can be downloaded from
the JasperForge Releases/Downloads area.

The recommended upgrade procedures are fully described in the
Installation Guide. See chapters 7 and 8.


4.0, 4.1, or 4.2 to 4.5
-----------------------

To upgrade from 4.0, 4.1, or 4.2.1 to 4.5, the
recommended procedure is described in the Installation Guide
Chapter 8. In this procedure, you run the auto-upgrade
script:

  js-upgrade-samedb-ce.bat/sh


3.7 to 4.5
----------

You can upgrade directly from 3.7 or 3.7.1 to 4.5.

The recommended procedure is described in the Installation Guide
Chapter 7. In this procedure, you run the auto-upgrade script:

  js-upgrade-newdb-ce.bat/sh

NOTE: This procedure sets your jasperadmin login password back 
to its default (jasperadmin). This issue will be fixed in a 
subsequent release.


Security After Upgrading to 4.5
-------------------------------

With the new security framework in JasperReports Server 4.5,
user input and values passed to reports are restricted to
avoid potential security threats. In particular:

* Parameter names and values cannot have tags (that is, the 
  < and > characters). If your business data contains tags, you 
  need to update the security configuration to allow them.

* SQL queries must start with SELECT and cannot have comments.
  If your reports or Domains have queries with comments, you
  must either remove the comments or update the security
  configuration to allow them.

These restrictions were added to comply with security guidelines
for web applications. Removing the restrictions may make the
application more vulnerable to attacks.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
7. Known Issues

* 10254: If your client application uses JasperReports Server's 
  web services to retrieve JasperReports binary files 
  (JasperPrint objects) your client application may crash when it  
  tries to retrieve a report that includes a chart. This is 
  caused by an incompatibility between the version of   
  JFreeCharts in your client application and the version of  
  JFreeCharts in JasperReports Server (currently 1.0.12). To  
  retrieve reports with charts using the web services, you  
  must upgrade your client application to use JFreeCharts 
  version 1.0.12.

  For more information, visit the JFreeCharts website at:
  http://www.jfree.org/

* 21798: Performance in Internet Explorer. When 
  JasperReports Server is accessed through Microsoft 
  Internet Explorer 7, performance may be impaired. 
  Jaspersoft recommends version 8 of Internet Explorer.
  
* 23235: JasperReports Server detects a conflict between JAR
  files when the application is hosted by Glassfish version 2.
  The JasperReports Server JARs in question are WEB-INF/lib/
  jackson-core-lgpl-1.7.4 and jackson-mapper-lgpl-1.7.4. See the
  Installation Guide for instructions to resolve this issue.
  
This defect, which was listed in the release notes of 
previous versions, was fixed in this release:

* 21953: (fixed) Previous version of JasperReports Server 
  didn't support MySQL 5.5 as a repository database host. 
  Jaspersoft now supports this configuration.
  
These defects, which were listed in the release notes of 
previous versions, were fixed in the 4.2.1 release:

* 21835: (fixed) Mac Installer. When installing to an existing 
  MySQL instance, some users report errors when a previous  
  installation of JasperReports Server exists. Because MySQL
  is no longer part of our installation, Jaspersoft has 
  determined that this issue no longer occurs.
  
* 21953: (partially fixed) Previous versions of JasperReports
  Server didn't support MySQL 5.5 as a data source. JasperReports
  Server now supports MySQL 5.5 as a data source. However, the
  server did not support it as a repository database in version
  4.2.1.

These defects, which were listed in the release notes of 
previous versions, were fixed in the 4.1 release:

* 20412: (fixed) Import-Export Help. The --help option for the
  js-import and js-export utilities was not displayed if a 
  database connection couldn't be made. Now, the --help option 
  returns information even if the database connection fails.

* 21580: (fixed) Import operation, cached permissions. After an
  import operation, if the import included permission changes to
  files or folders, cached permissions could interfere with the
  new permissions. Now, permission changes made during import are
  properly applied.
