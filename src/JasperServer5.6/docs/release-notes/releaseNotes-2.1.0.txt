1. Introduction

JasperServer builds on JasperReports as a comprehensive family of
Business Intelligence (BI) products, providing robust static and 
interactive reporting, report server, and data analysis 
capabilities. For business intelligence users, JasperSoft offers
JasperAnalysis, which runs seamlessly on JasperServer. 

These release notes describe the installation and available 
functionality at a high level; for details, please refer to the 
documentation, which is available at <install-dir>/docs
after installation. In particular, refer to the installation 
guide for instructions about installation tasks, such as running 
the installer, creating and updating the database, and deploying 
the WAR file.

3. What's New

JasperServer now includes these features:

    * Better Output to Excel - Excel output is now much more 
      data-centric.

    * Custom Data Source Improvements - Adding a custom data 
      source to JasperServer is now much simpler and well-
      documented. The custom data source can be used both by 
      JasperServer reports and by the Ad Hoc Editor. 

    * Import/Export uses Ant - Import and export now use Ant, 
      which is more portable and fixes the input line too long
      problem (defect 8106).

    * JasperServer Plugin for iReport enhancements - The 
      plugin now walks users through adding reports with 
      subreports. Also, the plugin now checks to make sure 
      report names follow JasperServer's naming rules.

    * Log in as - JasperServer administrators can now log in as 
      other users; this feature is available on the User page. It  
      allows administrators to make sure the security rules for 
      users are working as expected.

    * Report Wizard Usability Improvements - When creating or 
      editing a report unit using the Report Wizard, users can 
      click "Finish" if all required fields are complete, and 
      can jump to each step on which they want to work.

    * Name/Label Improvements - End users now see only business-
      friendly labels for reports instead of seeing file names.

    * Revamped Login Page - The out of the box Login page for 
      JasperServer is now much more informative. It includes 
      links to online demos, documentation, and the Support 
      Portal.

    * Scheduling via Web Services - Custom applications can now 
      call JasperServer scheduling functions via web services.

    * Web Services Can Run Locale-sensitive Reports - If 
      REPORT_LOCALE is passed in to runReport via web services 
      and the report in question has a resource bundle for the 
      specific locale, the report output is returned in the 
      relevant language.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
4. Known Issues

    * If your client application uses JasperServer's web 
      services to retrieve JasperReports, your client application 
      may crash when it tries to retrieve a report that includes 
      a chart. caused by an incompatibility between JFreeCharts 
      1.0.0 and This is JFreeCharts 1.0.3. To retrieve reports 
      with charts using the web services, you must upgrade your 
      client application to use JFreeCharts version 1.0.3.

      For more information, visit the JFreeCharts website at:
      http://www.jfree.org/

   * The JasperServer installers (Windows and Linux) do not 
     special characters at the end of user entered passwords.
     Such characters include: & ; $
