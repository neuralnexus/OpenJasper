1. Introduction


JasperIntelligence is an open source business intelligence platform from 
JasperSoft built by the team behind JasperReports, providing common services 
like security and metadata management, and the capability to easily add 
additional functionality. JasperIntelligence provides a managed,
stand alone Web reporting environment, as well as being able to be embedded
in existing Java Web applications, and services to a variety of technologies
through Web services, including the LAMP stack. By focusing on a clean
business API and using an advanced inversion of control architecture, 
JasperIntelligence can be easily integrated and customized for your needs.

The JasperServer Edition is specifically designed to provide a Web application
around JasperReports, the most popular open source reporting solution. The 
JasperServer Edition provides the ability to define and maintain JasperReports
in a Web application and Web services environment.

An extensible metadata repository defines all needed resources to run
JasperReports in a secure environment. Report parameters can be defined so
that the user can be prompted for required inputs as reports are run. Reports
can be scheduled to run at required times and report output can be stored in
a content repository and emailed.

The JasperAnalysis Edition adds OLAP capabilities, leveraging the underlying
services of the JasperIntelligence platform and extending the JasperServer 
Edition. The metadata repository can contain and manage OLAP metadata and 
connections. The JasperAnalysis Edition runs with an integrated ROLAP engine
and can connect to other OLAP services through the XML/A Web Services protocol,
such as Microsoft Analysis Services, SAP, SAS and Hyperion. The OLAP server can 
run standalone providing secure, managed access to data warehouses and 
providing options to address server scalability and reliability.

Following soon will be:

* Enhancements based on a defined roadmap and community requirements
  and contributions
* Metadata designers integrated with the platform
* Data integration services (ETL)




2. Release Distributions

BitRock Installers for Linux and Windows

These installers contain everything to install JasperIntelligence:
* Java 1.5
* Tomcat 5.5
* MySQL 5.0
* JasperIntelligence Web application WAR
* iReport with JasperIntelligence plugin

An installation wizard walks you through the setup, including:

* JasperServer Edition
* JasperAnalysis Edition
* iReport with JasperIntelligence plugin
* Server parameters
* Example data

If existing Java, Tomcat or MySQL instances are detected, you can opt 
to use those instead of the separate versions included in the installer.

The Linux version is certified to work with:
* RedHat
* Debian
* SUSE
* Gentoo



JasperIntelligence Web application WAR

A Web application providing the user interface for JasperIntelligence for 
installation in Tomcat, JBoss and other Java application servers. Comes with
an example database creation script for MySQL. Web services and scheduled jobs
are provided by this WAR.




iReport plugin for JasperIntelligence

iReport is the most popular graphical report editor for JasperReports, allowing
configuration, development and testing of JasperReports reports. It produces
JasperReports JRXML files. iReport is supported by JasperSoft.

This plugin extends iReport to allow the iReport user to connect to a 
JasperIntelligence installation to browse the repository, and download and 
upload resources needed for JasperServer report units. Reports can be tested
by running them from iReport in the server. The connection between iReport and 
JasperIntelligence is done through a Web Services interface.

4. Release Notes


Content Repository

The existing metadata repository was extended so that it stores also generated 
documents and not only metadata such as report units, data sources, or other 
report definition related resources. The output of the report generating 
process can be store in the repository in various formats such as PDF, HTML 
and XLS.


Report Scheduler

The new version introduces the report scheduler component that allows 
generating reports in background.  Users can define report-generating jobs and
schedule them to run at specific moments in the future, the output being stored
at configurable locations within the repository or sent out by email to the 
intended audience.


Event Viewer

The activity of the different components that make up the server application
can be monitored through the event viewer. Users are informed about the 
progress of the background processes such as scheduled report-generating jobs.


OLAP User interface

Metadata related to a data warehouse/mart in a relational database or 
accessible via XML/A can be defined through the user interface.

* Mondrian data warehouse schema
* OLAP view
    * XML/A or Mondrian connection
    * Starting MDX query

OLAP views are displayed through the JPivot based "slice and dice" user
interface.


OLAP Server

The server can be configured to run as an XML/A data service running Mondrian.
XML/A front ends, including other JasperAnalysis servers can connect to the 
OLAP server via Web Services and be authenticated against security providers 
and the server metadata.

The list of data warehouses/marts available for use can be configured and 
secured so that unauthorized users cannot access them.

Management functions (which will expand over time) include clearing the OLAP 
cache to deal with underlying data updates and 



Metadata Repository

* Extended to manage additional resource types and generated content.


Data Sources for Reports

* Custom data sources can be included in the server and metadata. See the 
  ReportDataSourceService class and the BeanDataSource example.

* The BeanDataSource can be used to loosely integrate custom data sources
  into the server.
  

Security

* Object level security is implemented. Individual metadata objects and
  folders can be secured. Security profiles are inherited from the containing 
  folder and its parents.

* Authentication against external services such as LDAP is synchronized
  with the server metadata.

* Deleting users is now implemented.


iReport plugin for JasperServer

Provides a user interface and connectivity to the server for all Web
Services outlined below. All report metadata objects and file types are 
supported. iReport 1.2.4 is bundled.


Web Services

Web services currently implemented:

* List of available reports
* Run report, with optional parameters
* Repository exploring
* Creation of report unit (jrxml, datasource, resources)
* Add/delete resources to/from folders/reportUnits
    * JRXML
    * Image
    * Resource bundle
    * JAR
    * Font

* The logged in user with name and roles is available as a parameter in 
  reports.


Platform

* Metadata import/export tool to move data between repositories. Dumps metadata
  to a file system, including files. Useful for migrating from test to 
  production, distribution, regression testing and upgrading versions. Metadata
  is represented in an open XML format.
