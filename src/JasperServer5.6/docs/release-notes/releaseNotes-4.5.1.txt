1. Introduction

JasperReports Server is a high-performance, standalone or
embeddable, Business Intelligence (BI) platform that provides
rich reporting and integrated in-memory analysis capabilities.

These release notes describe the installation and available 
functionality at a high level; for details, please refer to the 
online help. Please also refer to the documentation, which is 
available at <js-install>/docs after installation. In particular, 
refer to the Installation Guide for instructions about running 
the installer, creating and updating the database, deploying the 
WAR file, and upgrading from previous versions.

Note: JasperReports Server is governed by a License Agreement,
the text of which is found at <js-install>/Jaspersoft-
Subscription-Services-Agreement.txt. Please read it before you
login to JasperReports Server for the first time. If you
installed the server using the installer binary (rather than  
deploying a WAR file), you have already agreed to this license.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. What's New

JasperReports Server 4.2.1 now includes the following:
   
  * Improved user experience for iPad users - Includes improved  
    scrolling, performance, and usability. In particular, some 
    interface elements, such as the top level Search field, have  
    been streamlined to make better use of screen space.
    
  * Updated version of JasperReports Library and iReport 
    Designer - JasperReports Server 4.2.1 includes JasperReports 
    Library and iReport Designer 4.2.1, which include support for 
    PDF/A compliant PDF export, and the ability to apply 
    interactivity (sorting or filtering) to report components.


JasperReports Server 4.2 added these improvements:

  * Advanced Filtering - You can define filter criteria on more 
    than one field in the Ad Hoc Editor using a complex Boolean 
    expression (AND, OR, and NOT operators with nested 
    parentheses).
    
  * Interactive HTML reports - Using JasperReports Server, you
    can now create and publish reports that allow users to sort
    or filter in the browser. Users click to modify these
    reports on-the-fly. Interactivity is available for all 
    reports that use the table component.

  * Database Server Support:
    * PostgreSQL - The bundled database installed by default with
      JasperReports Server has changed from MySQL to PostgreSQL
      9.0.4. JasperReports Server continues to support a wide
      range of databases, including MySQL. MySQL users can set up
      JasperReports Server during installation to connect to their
      existing MySQL database. 

      In earlier releases, Jaspersoft also provided and installed
      the driver for the MySQL database. The installer no longer
      provides this driver. MySQL 5.1 users can download the JDBC
      driver, mysql-connector-java-5.1.17-bin.jar, from this web
      site: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

    * An existing (unbundled) PostgreSQL instance can be 
      located on a remote host. You need to enable remote 
      connections in the PostgreSQL configuration. See the 
      JasperReports Server Installation Guide for more 
      information. 

    * JasperReports Server now supports MySQL 5.5 as a data
      source. Note that MySQL 5.5 is not currently supported as 
      a repository database (see Known Issues).

  * iPad Support - JasperReports Server's web application now
    supports the Apple iPad running the Safari browser. In 
    this release, the server supports viewing content (such as
    browsing the repository; running and copying reports; and 
    viewing dashboards) and creating Ad Hoc reports. 

  * REST API - JasperReports Server now includes web services
    based on the REST (Representational State Transfer) style of
    architecture. In this release, the RESTful services allow
    you to access repository functionality, such as getting,
    putting, posting, and deleting objects in the repository. 

  * Ad Hoc Summaries - The default summary operation for 
    non-numeric fields in the Ad Hoc Editor is now Count. The 
    old default was Distinct Count, which could cause performance 
    issues with large data volumes. Previously saved reports 
    remain as-is, and Distinct Count is still available in the 
    editor.
    
  * Application Server Support - JasperReports Server now 
    supports these application server versions: 
    WebLogic 10.3.4 and Tomcat 7.0.19.

  * New HTML Output - The server includes two new options
    described in the JasperReports Server Administration Guide:

    * If your reports rely on Pro Charts (based on Fusion), you
      can specify whether the server uses Flash or HTML5 to
      render these charts. You can set this for the entire
      server or for individual reports.
      
    * JasperReports Server now includes a new XHTML exporter
      that is less strict with regard to overlapping HTML
      elements. You can specify whether the server uses the
      pre-existing HTML exporter or the new XHTML exporter. If
      you want your table component reports to be interactive,
      JasperReports Server must use the XHTML exporter.

JasperReports Server 4.1 added these improvements:

  * Ad Hoc for OLAP - The Ad Hoc Editor now allows you to select 
    an OLAP client connection when creating a report. The cube 
    metadata of the OLAP connection is applied to the report so 
    that the dimensions and measures can be added to the rows 
    and columns of a crosstab. Note that, in this release, 
    several limitations apply. For example, an OLAP-based Ad 
    Hoc report doesn't support sorting or scheduling. In 
    addition, XML/A connections aren't currently supported. 
    Jaspersoft will expand this feature in subsequent releases.

  * Localization of Input Controls - In previous releases, the 
    labels applied to a report's input controls could only 
    support a single language. Now, you can supply resource 
    bundles that define the input control's labels in various 
    languages. In addition, if the input control relies on a 
    fixed list of values, the list of values can also support 
    multiple languages. For more information, refer to the 
    JasperReports Server User guide.
    
  * UTF-8 Support for Domains - The Domain Designer now supports 
    IDs encoded in UTF-8. As a result, database table and field 
    names, as well as set and item IDs, can contain 
    international characters. This allows data architects to 
    work with the Domain Designer in their own language.

  * Support for native 64 bit installers - You can now download
    either 32 bit or 64 bit installers. The 64 bit installers
    contain a 64 bit version of Java 6 and a 64 bit version of
    MySQL 5.1  (replaced with PostgreSQL 9.0.4 in JasperReports 
    Server 4.2) as bundled components. The 64 bit Java 6 JVM runs 
    JasperReports Server with greater speed and performance. 

  * Evaluation licenses - The server installation provides  
    evaluation licenses for four editions of Jaspersoft 
    commercial servers and activates the Enterprise edition 
    license initially. Evaluation licenses are provided
    for these editions: Enterprise, Express, Professional, and 
    Workgroup. For more information, refer to the JasperReports 
    Server Evaluation Guide and the JasperReports Server 
    Installation Guide.


JasperReports Server 4.0.1 added these improvements:

  * Create > Dashboard - The dashboard editor can now be accessed
    from the Create menu.

  * Updated translation packs covering the new features released 
    in JasperServer 4.0 (in French, German, Spanish, Japanese, 
    and Simplified Chinese).

  * Support for these additional third party products: 
    
    * Application servers: WebLogic, GlassFish, WebSphere, 
      and WebLogic. 
    
    * Database types: PostgreSQL, DB2, and MS SQL Server
    
    For details, refer to the Release Distributions section 
    of this document.
    
  * Templates - Changes have been made to the server's UI 
    components:
    
    * In order to support certain application servers, some 
      JSP files (in /templates) have been renamed so that
      the names do not include the hash mark (#). These pages
      represent all types of dialogs (such as the About
      dialog and the Save As dialog), as opposed to generic
      components, such as page.jsp or container.jsp. All
      references to these JSPs in other pages have also
      been updated.
      
    * In the file system of the server's host, the templates 
      folder has been moved up one level from:
        
        jasperserver-pro/WEB-INF/jsp/modules/templates/ 
          to 
        jasperserver-pro/WEB-INF/jsp/templates/

JasperReports Server 4.0 added these improvements:

  * Product Naming - Several changes have been made to  
    Jaspersoft's product names; in particular: 
    * The former "JasperServer" is called "JasperReports Server" 
    * The former "JasperAnalysis" is called "Jaspersoft OLAP" 
    * The former "JasperETL" is called "Jaspersoft ETL" 
  
    These changes are reflected by our products, documentation, 
    and web content. 
  
  * Improved User Interface - The usability and look and feel of
    the JasperReports Server web user interface has been 
    improved to simplify many user tasks and to make it more
    visually appealing. The underlying framework introduced as
    part of this feature (Jaspersoft Interface Framework (JIF))
    allows the application's look and feel to be modified more
    quickly and easily than in previous releases. Note that 
    some types of customization may need to be implemented in
    a different way in this version than in previous versions.
    The User Interface Customization Guide (available on the 
    Support Portal) provides guidance about implementing 
    several types of customization. 

  * Application Themes - JasperReports Server now supports the 
    ability to define themes for the web interface that controls 
    its look and feel. These themes take advantage of JIF to let 
    users define Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), images, and other 
    graphical elements of the application. A theme can be defined 
    for the entire application, or for individual organizations. 
    Themes are stored in the repository and can be updated 
    without the need to restart the server. 

  * Improved Interaction - When a user navigates away from the 
    dashboard designer, Domain designer, or Ad Hoc Editor by 
    selecting one of the main menu options (for example, 
    clicking View > Repository), she is prompted that changes 
    may be lost if she continues. In addition, in the Ad Hoc
    Editor, if a user's session is about to expire, the server
    prompts her to click OK to continue working. These 
    improvements ensure that a user's work isn't lost. 

  * Mac OS X Installer Support - This release includes a new 
    installer for Mac OS X systems. For more information, 
    refer to the Installation Notes section in this file and 
    to the JasperReports Server Installation Guide. 
    
  * Installer Components Updated - The JasperReports Server
    installers have been updated to include more current 
    applications:
    * Tomcat has been updated from 5.5 to 6.0. 
    * MySQL has been updated from 5.0 to 5.1. 
    * Java has been updated from 1.5 to 1.6.
    
  * Buildomatic Ant Install Scripts Updated - In addition to the 
    binary installers (Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X) the  
    buildomatic installation files have been upgraded with 
    auto-install and auto-upgrade batch/shell scripts. Now a  
    single properties file and a single script execution can 
    carry out an installation or an upgrade.

  * Updated OLAP Engine - This release includes a new version of 
    Mondrian, the OLAP engine underlying Jaspersoft OLAP. The 
    new version of Mondrian is 3.2.0. Major improvements 
    include:
    
     * Improved native performance
     * olap4j drill through support
     * Improved XML/A support
     * Greenplum Dialect
     * Improved parameter support

  * Portlet Configuration - When a report that displays input 
    controls or filters appears in the JasperReports Server 
    portlet, its input controls and filters can be displayed 
    at the top of the report rather than displaying them in a 
    separate page. 

  * Execute-only Permission - A new level of access has been  
    added for repository objects. Execute-only permission gives 
    administrators finer control over what users see in the 
    repository. As in a file system, execute-only permission 
    allows regular users to access resources at run-time but 
    not browse or search for them in the repository. For example, 
    placing data sources in an execute-only folder allows users  
    to run reports and access the data, but hides the data 
    sources from the end-user. Administrators use the
    execute-only permission to hide supporting resources so that 
    end-users interact with only reports, dashboards, and OLAP 
    views in the repository. 

  * License Management - Jaspersoft has implemented new license 
    management technology that provides more flexibility in the 
    way we deliver solutions to our customers. The license 
    manager also displays warnings if your license will expire 
    in the near future. The new license manager is compatible 
    with previous licenses if they are otherwise valid. For more 
    information, refer to the JasperReports Server Installation 
    Guide.

6. Upgrade Notes 

You can upgrade directly to 4.2.1 if your instance is one of the 
following:

  * 3.7
  * 3.7.1
  * 4.0
  * 4.0.1
  * 4.1
  * 4.2
  
There are no database changes between 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.2.1. 
As a result, upgrade from 4.0, 4.1 or 4.2 is simpler than upgrade 
from earlier versions. 

To upgrade, start with the WAR File Distribution ZIP
(jasperreports-server-4.2-bin.zip). It can be downloaded from 
the Jaspersoft Support site http://support.jaspersoft.com.

The recommended upgrade procedures are fully described in the 
Installation Guide. See chapters 9 and 10.


4.0, 4.1, or 4.2 to 4.2.1
-----------------

To upgrade from 4.0, 4.0.1, 4.1 or 4.2 to 4.2.1, the recommended
procedure is described in the Installation Guide Chapter 10,
"Upgrade from 4.0 or 4.1 to 4.2." In this procedure, you will
run the "auto-upgrade" script:

  js-upgrade-samedb.bat/sh


3.7 to 4.2.1
----------

You can upgrade directly to 4.2.1 from version 3.7 or 3.7.1. 

The recommended procedure is described in the Installation Guide
Chapter 9, "Upgrade from 3.7 to 4.2." In this procedure, you
will run the "auto-upgrade" script:

  js-upgrade-newdb.bat/sh

follow the Installation Guide steps in Chapter 12, "Upgrading
from Community Project," in order to upgrade to the commercial
version.

These databases are currently supported:

  * DB2
  * MySQL
  * Oracle
  * PostgreSQL
  * SQL Server


-----------------------------------------------------------------
7. Known Issues

* 10254: If your client application uses JasperReports Server's 
  web services to retrieve JasperReports binary files 
  (JasperPrint objects) your client application may crash when it 
  tries to retrieve a report that includes a chart. This is 
  caused by an incompatibility between the version of 
  JFreeCharts available in your client application and the 
  version of JFreeCharts available in JasperReports Server
  (currently 1.0.12). To retrieve reports with charts using 
  the web services, you must upgrade your client application to
  use JFreeCharts version 1.0.12.
  
  For more information, visit the JFreeCharts website at:
  http://www.jfree.org/

* 17144: There is a conflict between the version of a library 
  (jodatime) shipped with WebLogic and the one shipped with 
  JasperReports Server. While it should be possible to workaround 
  this conflict by setting WebLogic's prefer-web-inf-classes 
  property to true, Jaspersoft has determined that this setting  
  doesn't have the desired effect.

  Instead, you must edit the setdomainEnv file to force 
  WebLogic to use the version of the library shipped with 
  JasperReports Server.

  To set this option in Windows, edit the setdomainEnv.bat file     
  and add the following line:
set PATCH_CLASSPATH=${PATH TO NEW JODA LIBRARY}\joda-time-1.6.jar

  To set this option in Linux, edit the setdomainEnv.sh file and 
  add the following line:
PATCH_CLASSPATH==${PATH TO NEW JODA LIBRARY}/joda-time-1.6.jar

  Since the root of this problem is in WebLogic (it fails to 
  respect the prefer-web-inf-classes property setting), 
  Jaspersoft has no plans to address the issue.

* 17824: While Fusion Charts support annotations, JasperReports 
  Server and iReport don't support them. Annotations cannot be 
  used in Pro Charts. Jaspersoft will address this issue 
  in a subsequent release. 
  
* 21798: Performance in Internet Explorer. When 
  JasperReports Server is accessed through Microsoft 
  Internet Explorer 7, performance may be impaired. 
  Jaspersoft recommends version 8 of Internet Explorer.
 
* 21835: Mac OS X Installer. When installing to an existing
  MySQL instance, users report errors if the computer once  
  hosted a previous installation of JasperReports Server. Until
  this issue is resolved, Jaspersoft recommends that you use the 
  bundled version of  MySQL. Jaspersoft will address this issue
  in a subsequent release. 
  
* 21953: This version of JasperReports Server doesn't support 
  MySQL 5.5 as a repository database host. Jaspersoft plans to
  support this configuration in a subsequent release.

* 22295: When JasperReports Server runs on WebSphere 6.1, its 
  performance may be unacceptably slow, particularly when users 
  edit OLAP connections. The workaround is to upgrade your 
  application server to WebSphere 7.0, which doesn't exhibit 
  these performance issues.
  
* 22896: When an Ad Hoc report that is based on an OLAP 
  connection is added to a dashboard, JasperReports Server 
  never properly displays the report. The dashboard can't be 
  saved. Jaspersoft will address this issue in a subsequent 
  release.
  
* 23759: Installing to an existing version of PostgreSQL 8.1.
  When using the binary installer, if you install to an existing
  version of PostgreSQL 8.1, you must manually update
  the DB privileges for the created jasperDB user. This is due 
  to outdated GRANT syntax in 8.1. See the Install Guide's 
  Troubleshooting section A.1 for details.
  
* 24172: When using the IBM version of the JDK and WebSphere 7,
  an exception is written to the server log when users create
  filters in Ad Hoc reports based on OLAP connections. 
  For example:
    java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException at mondrian.util.
    FilteredIterableList$1.set(FilteredIterableList.java:120)
  The Mondrian project has fixed this issue but has not yet
  included it in a release. The current workaround is to use
  the Sun JDK instead of the IBM JDK. 
  
* 24226: If the JasperReports Server repository is hosted by 
  PostgreSQL, your users' names are case-sensitive. This is not 
  the case for some other types of RDBMS. This is because 
  PostgreSQL defaults to case-sensitive. Jaspersoft will address 
  this issue in a subsequent release.

These defects, which were listed in the release notes of 
previous versions, have been fixed in JasperReports Server 4.2:

* 21953: (partially fixed) Previous versions of JasperReports
  Server didn't support MySQL 5.5 as a data source. JasperReports
  Server now supports MySQL 5.5 as a data source. However, the
  server does not support it as a repository database.

* 23235: (fixed) In a previous release, Jaspersoft reported a
  conflict between JAR files when the application was hosted by
  Glassfish version 2. The JasperReports Server JARs in question
  were WEB-INF/lib/jackson-core-lgpl-1.7.4 and
  jackson-mapper-lgpl-1.7.4. Jaspersoft has determined that this
  issue no longer occurs.
  
  
These defects, which were listed in the release notes of
previous versions, were fixed in JasperReports Server 4.1:

* 11847: (fixed) When JasperReports Server was installed using
  the bundled version of MySQL, and the computer already hosted a 
  version of MySQL, the installer sometimes failed with an error 
  indicating that it couldn't connect to MySQL. Now, the error
  no longer occurs.

* 17000: (fixed) When working with a dashboard that included a
  report that relied on cascading input controls, the input
  controls had to be added in the correct order. For example, if
  you had a State input control that cascaded from a Country input 
  control, you had to add the Country input control before adding 
  the State input control. This limitation has been removed.

* 17016: (fixed) While the Ad Hoc Editor supported null values in
  input controls, they were not supported when the report was 
  run. This limitation has been removed.

* 17559: (fixed) Glassfish2 with PostgreSQL and Java 1.6. When
  using PostgreSQL, Java 1.6, and JDBC, you had to set the 
  jdbc-connection-pool so that 1.6 JDBC methods were not called
  This requirement has been removed.

* 20412: (fixed) Import-Export Help. The --help option for the
  js-import and js-export utilities was not displayed if database 
  connection couldn't be made. Now, the --help option returns 
  information even if the database connection fails.

* 21580: (fixed) Import operation, cached permissions. After an
  import operation, if the import included permission changes to
  files or folders, cached permissions could interfere with the
  new permissions. Now, permission changes made during import are
  properly applied.
  
* 22295: (partially fixed) When JasperReports Server runs on 
  WebSphere 6.1, its performance was sometimes unacceptably slow, 
  particularly when users scheduled reports. The workaround was 
  to upgrade your application server to WebSphere 7.0, which 
  doesn't exhibit these performance issues. Note that, in this 
  configuration, users may still experience unacceptable 
  performance when editing OLAP connections.
