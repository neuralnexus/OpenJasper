1. Introduction

JasperServer is specifically designed to provide a Web application around
JasperReports, the most popular open source reporting solution. Continuing
the philosophy of JasperReports, JasperServer provides a managed,
stand alone Web reporting environment, as well as being able to be embedded
in existing Java Web applications, and services to a variety of technologies
through Web services, including the LAMP stack. By focusing on a clean
business API and using an advanced inversion of control architecture, 
JasperServer can be easily integrated and customized for your needs. 

This first public release of JasperServer provides the ability to define 
and maintain JasperReports in a Web application and Web services environment.
An extensible metadata repository defines all needed resources to run
JasperReports in a secure environment. Report parameters can be defined so
that the user can be prompted for required inputs as reports are run.

JasperIntelligence is an open source business intelligence platform from 
JasperSoft built by the team behind JasperReports, providing common services 
like security and metadata management, and the capability to easily add 
additional functionality. JasperServer is the first service using the 
JasperIntelligence platform. Following soon will be:

* JasperServer enhancements based on a defined roadmap and community requirements
  and contributions
* Report and metadata designers integrated with the platform
* OLAP user interfaces
* Data warehouse management environments
* Data integration services (ETL)




2. Release Distributions

BitRock Installers for Linux and Windows

These installers contain everything to install JasperServer:
* Java 1.5
* Tomcat 5.5
* MySQL 5.0

Tomcat or MySQL instances are detected, you can opt to use those instead of 
the separate versions included in the installer.

The Linux version is certified to work with:
* RedHat
* Debian
* SUSE
* Gentoo

Web application

* This has been tested with Tomcat 5.0 and 5.5, running JDK 1.5.

* Cookies need to be allowed to login to the web application. This will be 
  fixed in a future release.


Create Report

Name and Label are mandatory fields for resources, Description is optional



View Report

For Data Types of type DATE, a pattern should be supplied, otherwise the 
default date format pattern is used for the locale of the server is used. 
When specified, the pattern is displayed at the right of the input control 
in the parameters input form.

RTF output is not available, though JasperReports can produce such output.



Metadata Repository


The repository is backed by a database and accessed via Hibernate 3.1.2. 
The default implementation is for MySQL 5.0. Through the setting of 
configuration parameters, alternate databases can be supported, as database
creation scripts are generated through the build process.


Data Sources for Reports


Only JDBC data sources for reports are supported in this release.

Data sources (JDBC or JNDI based) created in the application are not tested
at configuration time to ensure they are usable.

With non JNDI data sources, JDBC drivers need to be either on the application
server classpath, or included as resources in report units.


Security

As installed, the user names and passwords for the application are stored
in the metadata repository, and use form based authentication. Based on the 
use of the Acegi Security framework, the authentication mechanism can be 
changed to use external authentication services like LDAP. The application 
does not currently manage the distinction between externally defined users 
and roles.

Passwords are unencrypted in the database.

Deleting users is not implemented.

Object level security is implemented, but not tested.


Web Services

Web services are currently limited to:
* Login
* List of available reports
* Run report, with optional parameters. HTML only



PHP example application

Only HMTL JasperReports can be rendered.
