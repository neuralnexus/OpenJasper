1. Introduction


JasperIntelligence is an open source business intelligence platform from 
JasperSoft built by the team behind JasperReports, providing common services 
like security and metadata management, and the capability to easily add 
additional functionality. JasperIntelligence provides a managed,
stand alone Web reporting environment, as well as being able to be embedded
in existing Java Web applications, and services to a variety of technologies
through Web services, including the LAMP stack. By focusing on a clean
business API and using an advanced inversion of control architecture, 
JasperIntelligence can be easily integrated and customized for your needs.

The JasperServer Edition is specifically designed to provide a Web application
around JasperReports, the most popular open source reporting solution. The 
JasperServer Edition provides the ability to define and maintain JasperReports
in a Web application and Web services environment.

An extensible metadata repository defines all needed resources to run
JasperReports in a secure environment. Report parameters can be defined so
that the user can be prompted for required inputs as reports are run. Reports
can be scheduled to run at required times and report output can be stored in
a content repository and emailed.

The JasperAnalysis Edition adds OLAP capabilities, leveraging the underlying
services of the JasperIntelligence platform and extending the JasperServer 
Edition. The metadata repository can contain and manage OLAP metadata and 
connections. The JasperAnalysis Edition runs with an integrated ROLAP engine
and can connect to other OLAP services through the XML/A Web Services protocol,
such as Microsoft Analysis Services, SAP, SAS and Hyperion. The OLAP server can 
run standalone providing secure, managed access to data warehouses and 
providing options to address server scalability and reliability.

Following soon will be:

* Enhancements based on a defined roadmap and community requirements
  and contributions
* Metadata designers integrated with the platform
* Data integration services (ETL)

JasperIntelligence Web application WAR

A Web application providing the user interface for JasperIntelligence for 
installation in Tomcat, JBoss and other Java application servers. Comes with
an example database creation script for MySQL. Web services and scheduled jobs
are provided by this WAR.




iReport plugin for JasperIntelligence

iReport is the most popular graphical report editor for JasperReports, allowing
configuration, development and testing of JasperReports reports. It produces
JasperReports JRXML files. iReport is supported by JasperSoft.

This plugin extends iReport to allow the iReport user to connect to a 
JasperIntelligence installation to browse the repository, and download and 
upload resources needed for JasperServer report units. Reports can be tested
by running them from iReport in the server. The connection between iReport and 
JasperIntelligence is done through a Web Services interface.

4. Release Notes


Queries as Resources

Reusable queries can now be stores as resource in the repository. A report unit
can reference an existing query from the repository, instead of relying on the
query from the associated JRXML file. Furthermore, the queries can be written
in other query languages than SQL, as long as the corresponding data source 
they are executed against, supports it.



Query-backed Input Controls

List input controls can be filled with values returned by a reusable query from
the repository, instead of a normal, predefined list of values.



Enhanced Input Controls

In addition to the existing single select input controls, radio button input
controls, multi-select lists and checkbox list are now available, both backed
by predefined list of values or by queries.



Drill-through Reports

The support for hyperlinks was enhanced so that other reports could be easily 
linked from currently viewed report and the end user could navigate and drill
through from one report to another to view more detailed information.
Parameter values are passed along automatically from one report to the next 
using a session context and in case mandatory parameters for a given report
are missing, the input controls form that correspond to that particular report
pops up and prompts for those missing parameters at the appropriate moment.



Drill-through Charts

The chart component in JasperReports was also enhanced so that it supports
associating different hyperlinks to the different items that make up the chart
graphic and be able to navigate to a different report by clicking on a specific
are of the chart. This is now leveraged in JasperIntelligence where reports
can be chained up and parameter information be passed automatically to achieve
the drill-thought effect.



Reports by Direct URL

Reports from the repository can be now called directly and all their required
parameters can be encoded in the URL, to avoid the intermediate input control
form and/or the repository browser navigation to the report.
