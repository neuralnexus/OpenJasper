2. Introduction

JasperServer is specifically designed to provide a web 
application around JasperReports, the most popular open
source reporting solution. Continuing the philosophy of
JasperReports, JasperServer provides a managed, stand-alone
web reporting environment. You can also embed JasperServer
in existing Java web applications and services and to a
variety of technologies, including the LAMP stack. By
focusing on a clean business API and using an advanced
inversion of control architecture, JasperServer
can be easily integrated and customized for your needs. 

JasperServer provides the ability to define and maintain
JasperReports in a web application and web services 
environment. An extensible metadata repository defines 
all resources needed to run JasperReports in a secure
environment. You can define report parameters to prompt
users for required input when reports are run.


3. What's New

The main new feature in JasperServer 1.2 is the i18n
internationalization work. This is a full localization 
implementation supporting:

 * Selected character encoding throughout the product
 * Web Application UI localization
 * Report localization
 * OLAP Analysis view localization
 * Timezone localization
 
The released product comes with externalized resource
bundles for the default English language implementation.

Included with this release is a localization guide which 
gives a step by step description of how customers can 
fully localize their instance of JasperServer. You can find
this guide in the <install-dir>/docs directory.
