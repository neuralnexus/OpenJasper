1. Introduction

JasperServer builds on JasperReports as a comprehensive family of
Business Intelligence (BI) products, providing robust static and 
interactive reporting, report server, and data analysis 
capabilities. For business intelligence users, JasperSoft offers
JasperAnalysis, which runs seamlessly on JasperServer. 

These release notes describe the installation and available 
functionality at a high level; for details, please refer to the 
documentation, which is available at <install-dir>/docs
after installation. In particular, refer to the installation 
guide for instructions about installation tasks, such as running 
the installer, creating and updating the database, and deploying 
the WAR file.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. Installation Notes

Once JasperServer is installed, the login page URL is:

    http://<hostname>:<port>/jasperserver

The default login page URL for Tomcat is:

    http://<hostname>:8080/jasperserver

During installation, a default administrative user is 
created:

    Username: jasperadmin
    Password: jasperadmin

If you install the sample data, and end user is also 
created:

    Username:  joeuser
    Password:  joeuser

3. What's New

JasperServer now includes these features:

    * Repository Manager - JasperServer's main web interface has 
      been modernized, improved, and expanded to support features 
      such as drag and drop moving and the ability to copy 
      repository resources. The new look and feel also simplifies 
      an administrator's view of the repository to improve ease of 
      maintenance.

    * Flash Viewer - Along with the existing output formats, 
      JasperServer now supports the ability to view a report in 
      Flash (SWF) format. When you view a report in Flash, you 
      can navigate through its pages, zoom in or out, and print 
      it.

    * Importer Update Option - The importer can now replace an 
      existing repository resource with a new resource of the 
      same type. This is helpful during upgrade, and when moving 
      between test and production environments.

    * Internationalization of Input Controls - A report's input 
      control labels can reside in the report's resource bundles. 
      In this case, Users will see these labels in their 
      preferred locale.

    * Password Expiration - Administrators can now configure 
      JasperServer to require users to change their passwords at 
      regular intervals. This feature is disabled by default; 
      when it is enabled, JasperServer also now enables users 
      to change their own passwords.

    * Improved Installer Work Flow - The user interface to the 
      installation executable has been simplified and improved
      to facilitate deployment of JasperServer in its most common
      configuration.

    * Top of Page Controls - Report designers now have the option 
      to display input controls at the top of the report page, 
      rather than displaying them on a separate page or in a 
      pop-up window. When a report has only a few controls, 
      placing them at the top of the report page can improve 
      your users' experience.

    * JasperReports Text Improvements - JasperReports, the 
      reporting library at the heart of the JasperSoft Business 
      Intelligence Suite, now supports customizable text 
      truncation that can depend on the export format requested; 
      it also includes a custom text measurer.

    * Heartbeat Data Collection - During installation, JasperSoft 
      requests that you opt-in to our heartbeat feature. 
      System data that is collected such as Operating System,
      JVM type and version, Application Server type and version,
      etc. will help us support our customers by providing
      a deeper understanding of the real-world implementations
      of JasperServer. Help us to help you by letting us
      know about your environment. No personal information
      is collected. For details, please visit 
      http://www.jaspersoft.com/heartbeat.

    * User Authentication via URL - You can now programmatically 
      log users into JasperServer, and direct them to a specific 
      report, analysis view, or dashboard by specifying the 
      username and password as parameters to the URL. For 
      example, you could pass the following URL to JasperServer 
      to display the All Accounts sample report:
      http://localhost:8080/jasperserver/flow.html?_flowId=
      viewReportFlow&reportUnit=/reports/samples/AllAccounts&
      j_username=jasperadmin&j_password=jasperadmin

    * Pass Locale as Parameter via URL - When running 
      JasperServer reports via URLs, you can now 
      programmatically specify the locale to use for the
      report. For example, you could pass the following
      URL to JasperServer to display the Freight sample 
      report in Portuguese: 
      http://aphid:8080/jasperserver/flow.html?_flowId=
      viewReportFlow&reportUnit=/reports/samples/Freight&
      reportLocale=pt_BR

    * Data encryption for iReport - By default, iReport stores 
      user passwords in clear text format. To improve security 
      for organizations with strict security policies, iReport 
      can now be configured to store user passwords in an 
      encrypted format. To change this configuration, edit the 
      default.jasperserver_irplugin.properties file in your 
      iReport installation.


Release 3.0.0 addresses the following community reported 
issues:

    * artf3273: Email address that had more than one dot
      such as: john.doe@john.doe.org did not pass validation.
      Validation code has been updated to allow multiple 
      dots.

    * artf3055: There was an Acegi security error on a 
      recursive scheduling setup for a report. Recursive
      scheduling has been fixed for this issue.
      
    * artf3053: js-import-export.sh failed on Solaris.
      Fixed by adding apostrophes to the failing line
      in the script.

    * artf3032: Deleting the root directory "/" via the 
      Web Services API caused repository corruption. The
      root directory can no longer be deleted via the Web
      Services API.
      
    * artf3030: Unable to set the "Always prompt" flag for 
      a report via the Web Services interface. This has
      now been enabled.

    * artf3008 & artf2671: New users added to JasperServer 
      via LDAP caused exception under Oracle as the repository.
      To fix the problem the transaction attributes were updated
      in the ApplicationContext.xml for the userAuthorityService.

    * artf3004: Invalid data accepted for Date in an input control
      such as a month greater than 12. Validations have been
      updated.
      
    * artf2973: Hibernate exception after deleting and recreating
      a Report Unit (when upper/lower case is different). Fixed by
      properly clearing the engine cache on a Report Unit delete
      operation.



-----------------------------------------------------------------
4. Known Issues

    * 10254: If your client application uses JasperServer's web 
      services to retrieve JasperReports, your client application 
      may crash when it tries to retrieve a report that includes 
      a chart. This is caused by an incompatibility between 
      JFreeCharts 1.0.0 and JFreeCharts 1.0.3. To retrieve 
      reports with charts using the web services, you must 
      upgrade your client application to use JFreeCharts version 
      1.0.3.

      For more information, visit the JFreeCharts website at:
      http://www.jfree.org/

    * 11634: The JasperServer installers (Windows and Linux) do 
      not support special characters at the end of user entered 
      passwords. Such characters include: & ; $
      
    * 11847: When JasperServer is installed using the bundled 
      version of MySQL, and the computer already hosts a version
      of MySQL, the installer may fail with an error indicating
      that it couldn't connect to MySQL. This Windows-only problem
      occurs intermittently. The workaround is to uninstall
      JasperServer, reinstall it, and select the existing MySQL
      option. JasperSoft will address this issue in a subsequent
      release.
