1. Introduction

JasperReports Server Community Project is a high-performance,
standalone and embeddable Business Intelligence (BI) platform 
that provides rich reporting capabilities. In addition, 
Jaspersoft OLAP provides OLAP data analysis, running on the same 
shared BI platform. 

These release notes describe the installation and available 
functionality at a high level; for details, please refer to the 
documentation, which is available at <js-install>/docs after 
installation. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. Installation Notes

To install JasperReports Server, you can use the binary 
installer, which is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac (the 
Mac installer is brand new!). This installer can put Tomcat, Java, 
and MySQL onto your system so that JasperReports Server is ready 
to go. 

Additionally, there are new "auto-install" command line based
shell scripts. Use these scripts can be used if you are 
installing to PostgreSQL, JBoss, or Glassfish (also Tomcat and 
MySQL).

For more information on JasperReports Server installation, refer
to the install guide which is found at:

    <js-install>/docs/JasperReports-Server-CP-Install-Guide.pdf


Once JasperReports Server is installed, the login page URL is:

    http://<hostname>:<port>/jasperserver

The default login page URL for Tomcat is:

    http://<hostname>:8080/jasperserver

During installation, a default administrative user is 
created:

    Username: jasperadmin
    Password: jasperadmin

If you install the sample data, an end user is also 
created:

    Username:  joeuser
    Password:  joeuser


-----------------------------------------------------------------
3. Upgrade Notes 

JasperReports Server now comes with command-line-based 
"auto-upgrade" shell scripts. These scripts handle many aspects 
of upgrading from 3.7 to 4.0.

To upgrade, start with the WAR File Distribution ZIP which 
can be downloaded from JasperForge.org:

  jasperreports-server-cp-4.0.0-bin.zip 

After unpacking the ZIP, the "auto-upgrade" scripts is in the 
following location:

  <unpack-dir>/buildomatic/
  
                     js-upgrade-newdb-ce.bat/.sh
                     
                     js-upgrade-samedb-ce.bat/.sh

For more information on the upgrade steps, refer to the 
installation guide found at this location:

  <unpack-dir>/docs/JasperReports-Server-CP-Install-Guide.pdf

Look for the following chapters:

  Upgrade from JasperServer 3.7 to JasperReports Server 4.0
  
  Upgrade Using SQL Upgrade Script

The "in-place" database upgrade SQL scripts are located at:

    <unpack-dir>/buildomatic/install_resources/sql/<db-type>/

Supported databases are:

    - MySQL
    - PostgreSQL


-----------------------------------------------------------------
4. What's New

JasperReports Server now includes the following:

  * Product Naming. Several changes have been made to  
    Jaspersoft's product names; in particular: 
    * The former "JasperServer" is called "JasperReports Server" 
    * The former "JasperAnalysis" is called "Jaspersoft OLAP" 
  
  These changes are reflected by our products, documentation, 
  and web content. 
  
  * Improved User Interface. The usability and look and feel of 
    the JasperReports Server web user interface has been 
    improved to simplify many user tasks and to make it more 
    visually appealing. The underlying framework introduced as 
    part of this feature (Jaspersoft Interface Framework (JIF)) 
    allows the application's look and feel to be modified more 
    quickly and easily than in previous releases. Note that some 
    types of customization may need to be implemented in a 
    different way in this version than in previous versions.

  * Application Themes. JasperReports Server now supports the 
    ability to define themes for the web interface that control 
    its look and feel. These themes take advantage of JIF to let 
    users define Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), images, and other 
    graphical elements of the application. Themes can stored in 
    the repository and can be updated without the need to restart 
    the server. 

  * Macintosh Installer Support. This release includes a new 
    installer for Macintosh computers. For more information, 
    refer to the Installation Notes section of this doc and to
    the JasperReports Server Installation Guide. 
    
  * Installer Components Updated. The JasperReports Server
    installers have been updated to provide more current 
    applications:
    * Tomcat has been updated from 5.5 to 6.0. 
    * MySQL has been updated from 5.0 to 5.1. 
    * Java has been updated from 1.5 to 1.6.
    
  * Buildomatic Ant Install Scripts Updated. In addition to the 
    binary installers (Windows, Linux, and Mac) the buildomatic 
    installation files have been upgraded with "auto-install" and
    "auto-upgrade" batch/shell scripts. Now a single properties 
    file and a single script execution complete most steps for 
    installing or upgrading the server.

  * Updated OLAP Engine. This release includes a new version of 
    Mondrian, the OLAP engine underlying Jaspersoft OLAP. The 
    new version of Mondrian is 3.2.0. Major improvements 
    include:
    
     * Improved native performance
     * olap4j drill through support
     * Improved XML/A support
     * Greenplum Dialect
     * Improved parameter support

  * Execute-only Permission. A new level of access has been added 
    for repository objects. Execute-only permission gives 
    administrators finer control over what users see in the 
    repository. As in a file system, execute-only permission 
    allows regular users to access resources at run-time but 
    not browse or search for them in the repository. For example, 
    placing data sources in an execute-only folder allows users  
    to run reports and access the data, but hides the data 
    sources from the end user. Administrators can use the
    execute-only permission to hide supporting resources so that 
    end-users interact with only reports, dashboards, and OLAP 
    views in the repository. 

  * Log Setting Page. The new log settings page, accessible to 
    administration users by clicking Manage > Log Settings, lets 
    you change the  logging levels without restarting 
    JasperReports Server.
    
  * New JasperReports version 4.0.0 is included in JasperReports 
    Server. A new CSV query executer is added to simplify the
    configuring of CSV data sources. Also, a new CSV metadata
    exporter has been added to better control the CSV export. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
5. Known Issues

* 10254: If your client application uses JasperReports Server's 
  web services to retrieve JasperReports binary files 
  (JasperPrint objects) your client application may crash when it  
  tries to retrieve a report that includes a chart. This is 
  caused by an incompatibility between the version of   
  JFreeCharts in your client application and the version of  
  JFreeCharts in JasperReports Server (currently 1.0.12). To  
  retrieve reports with charts using the web services, you  
  must upgrade your client application to use JFreeCharts 
  version 1.0.12.

  For more information, visit the JFreeCharts website at:
  http://www.jfree.org/
      
* 21580: Import operation, cached permissions. After an import 
  operation, if the import included permission changes to files 
  or folders, you should clear your application server temp 
  folder. This is necessary because cached permissions could 
  interfere with the new permissions. For Tomcat, the location 
  to clear is <tomcat>/temp.

* 21953: The JasperReports Server repository database has issues 
  under MySQL 5.5. There is a conflict with a new reserved word:
  MAXVALUE. Also, the storage engine needs to be specified as 
  engine=Innodb (instead of type=Innodb).
  
* 21835: Mac Installer. When installing to an  existing MySQL
  instance, some users report errors when a previous  
  installation of JasperReports Server exists. Until fixed, 
  Jaspersoft recommends that you use the bundled version of 
  MySQL.
  
* 20412: Import-Export --help option not displayed if DB 
  connection cannot be made. For js-import.bat./sh and 
  js-export.bat/.sh. Current workaround is to make sure that the
  import-export scripts are properly  configured. See the install
  guide's chapter 14   "Configuring Import-Export Utilities".
