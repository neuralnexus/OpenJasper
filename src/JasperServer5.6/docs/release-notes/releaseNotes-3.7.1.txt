1. Introduction

JasperServer Community Edition is a high-performance,
standalone and embeddable Business Intelligence (BI) platform 
that provides rich reporting capabilities. In addition, 
JasperAnalysis provides OLAP data analysis, running on the same 
shared JasperServer BI platform. 

These release notes describe the installation and available 
functionality at a high level; for details, please refer to the 
documentation, which is available at <js-install>/docs after 
installation. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. Installation Notes

After running the JasperServer CE installer, you can find
information about the installation in the Installation Guide:

    <js-install>/docs/JasperServer-CE-Install-Guide.pdf

For instructions to install the binary WAR file, refer to the
Installation Guide in the ZIP archive:

    <js-bin>/docs/JasperServer-CE-Install-Guide.pdf

Once JasperServer is installed, the login page URL is:

    http://<hostname>:<port>/jasperserver

The default login page URL for Tomcat is:

    http://<hostname>:8080/jasperserver

During installation, a default administrative user is 
created:

    Username: jasperadmin
    Password: jasperadmin

created:

    Username:  joeuser
    Password:  joeuser

3. Upgrade Notes 


Upgrading from 3.7.0 to 3.7.1
-----------------------------

If you are upgrading from 3.7.0 to 3.7.1, you will need to 
update the jasperserver war file in your application server
deployment location. The jasperserver repository database
has not changed between 3.7.0 and 3.7.1. So, there are
no database changes required.

You will need to pay attention to any local configurations
and customizations that you have in your environment. 

If you start with the War File Distribution zip 
(jasperserver-ce-3.7.1-bin.zip), you can look at the 
JasperServer Install Guide, sections 5.6 and 5.7. 
These describe how to use the "buildomatic" scripts
to handle an installation. 

Since there are no database updates between 3.7.0
and 3.7.1, you would only need to run the following
buildomatic target (from section 5.7):

 js-ant deploy-webapp-ce


Upgrading from 3.5 to 3.7.1
---------------------------

The version upgrade steps to go from JasperServer 3.5 to 
JasperServer 3.7.1 are the same as they were for the 
3.7.0 release. 

For JasperServer Community Edition there are two upgrade paths:
1. Utilize the import-export utility to move resources
   from your existing JasperServer instance to your new 3.7.1 
   instance. 
2. Do an "in-place" database upgrade using an SQL upgrade script.

Refer to these chapters of the JasperServer CE Installation 
Guide for upgrade instructions: 

    Chapter:  Upgrade from JasperServer 3.5 to 3.7
  
    Chapter:  Upgrade Using SQL Upgrade Script

The upgrade scripts are located at:

    <js-install>/scripts/upgrade/      OR

    <js-install>/buildomatic/install_resources/sql/<db-type>/

Supported databases are:

    - MySQL
    - PostgreSQL

  is now certified on Windows Vista and Windows 7.
    - See Known Issues section below (item 17253)

  of users, roles, permissions, and cascading

     external browser links

Explorer 6.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
5. Known Issues

* 17253: iReport 3.7.1, which is bundled with the JasperServer
  installer, needs special handling in order to run with Vista or
  Windows 7. On these OS platforms, iReport  must run with the
  most current versions of Java 1.6 or the current version
  of the Java 1.7 beta. On these OS platforms, iReport will 
  require JDKs greater or equal to: 1.6.0_18-b03 or 1.7.0-b74.
  Additionally, you will need to modify the iReport loader script
  to point to this higher Java version. Edit the following file
  file: <js-install>\ireport\bin\iReportLoader.bat
  
  Change this line: SET JAVADIR=%CD%\java
  To this line: SET JAVADIR=<path-to-java-1.7>\java
  For example: SET JAVADIR=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0

* 10254: If your client application uses JasperServer's web
  services to retrieve JasperReports binary files (JasperPrint
  objects) your client application may crash when it tries to 
  retrieve a report that includes a chart. This is caused by an
  incompatibility between the version of JFreeCharts available in 
  your client application and the version of JFreeCharts 
  available in JasperServer (currently 1.0.12). To retrieve 
  reports with charts using the web services, you must upgrade 
  your client application to use JFreeCharts version 1.0.12.
