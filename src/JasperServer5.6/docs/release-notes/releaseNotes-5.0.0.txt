-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Introduction

JasperReports Server Community Project is a high-performance,
standalone and embeddable Business Intelligence (BI) platform 
that provides rich reporting capabilities. In addition, 
Jaspersoft OLAP provides data analysis running on the same 
shared BI platform. 

These release notes describe the installation and available 
functionality at a high level; for details, please refer to the 
documentation, which is available at <js-install>/docs after 
installation. In particular, refer to the Installation Guide for 
instructions about running the installer, creating and updating 
the database, deploying the WAR file, and upgrading from 
previous versions.

Note: JasperReports Server is governed by a License Agreement,
the text of which is found at <js-install>/license.txt. Please 
read it before you login to JasperReports Server for the first 
time. If you installed the server using the installer binary 
(rather than deploying a WAR file), you have already agreed to 
this license.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. What's New


JasperReports Server 5.0 offers these improvements:
    
 *  Relative Date Handling. Reports and dashboards now provide
    the ability to specify relative dates in input controls.
    For example, you could enter WEEK - 1 in a Start Date input 
    control to retrieve all the data for the last seven days. 
    Supported keywords in this release are DAY, WEEK, MONTH,
    QUARTER, SEMI (that is, half-year), and YEAR.

  * Report Viewer Improvements - The report viewer now offers 
    conditional formatting of table fields and an improved UI. 

  * Extended XML/A support - JasperReports Server can now connect 
    to Microsoft SQL Server Analytic Services to populate views 
    and reports with multi-dimensional OLAP data. For 
    configuration details, refer to the Jaspersoft OLAP User Guide.

  * Component upgrades - Jaspersoft has upgraded some third 
    party components of the server. Groovy 2.0 is a more powerful 
    scripting language with better type checking and static 
    compilation. EHCache reimplements the Ad Hoc cache with the 
    ability to measure memory usage and enforce limits on total 
    memory usage.

  * User profile attributes - JasperReports Server now provides 
    access to user's profile attributes through the web UI's 
    Manage > Users page.
    
  * PHP SDK - This new package lets users interact with 
    JasperReports Server using PHP. A set of PHP classes wrap the 
    server's web services REST API with easy to use business 
    logic so that you can focus on your PHP application rather 
    than its interactions with the server.

      
-----------------------------------------------------------------
3. Installation Overview

Binary Installer
----------------

To install JasperReports Server, you can use the binary
installer, which is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.
This installer optionally puts Tomcat, Java, and PostgreSQL
onto your system so that JasperReports Server is ready to run.

To install, go to the buildomatic folder, create and edit a 
default_master.properties file, and run js-install-ce.bat/sh:

  cd <js-install>/buildomatic
  
  cp sample_conf/<dbType>_master.properties  default_master.properties

  edit default_master.properties  (with your app server and db properties)

  ./js-install-ce.sh  (or js-install-ce.bat)

  Then setup increased JAVA_OPT memory options for your application
  server following instructions from the Install Guide section 6.2:
  
    For example under Linux:
  
    export JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xms1024m -Xmx2048m -XX:PermSize=32m
    -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -Xss2m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC 
    -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled"

For full information on the js-install-ce script installation, 
refer to the Installation Guide, which is found at:

  <js-install>/docs/JasperReports-Server-Install-Guide.pdf

-----------------------------------------------------------------
6. Upgrade Notes


You can upgrade directly to 4.7.0 if your instance is one of the
following:

  * 3.7.0
  * 3.7.1
  * 4.0.0
  * 4.1.0
  * 4.2.1
  * 4.5.0
  * 4.7.0

To upgrade, start with the WAR File Distribution ZIP:

  jasperreports-server-cp-5.0.0-bin.zip
  
It can be downloaded from http://community.jaspersoft.com/download.

The recommended upgrade procedures are fully described in the
Installation Guide. See chapters 8 and 9.


Database Changes
----------------

The jasperserver repository database has changed between version
4.5.0 and 4.7.0. These changes support the upgrade of the quartz 
scheduler component version as well as feature updates, such as 
scheduled report job enhancements.


3.7.0, 4.0.0, 4.1.0, 4.2.1, or 4.5.0 to 5.0
-------------------------------------------

You can upgrade directly to 5.0.0 if you are at a version number 
listed above.

The recommended procedure is described in the Installation Guide 
Chapter 8. In this procedure, you run the js-upgrade script:

  js-upgrade-newdb-ce.bat/sh


NOTE: This procedure sets your jasperadmin login password back to its
default (jasperadmin). This issue will be fixed in a subsequent release.


4.7.0 to 5.0
---------------------

To upgrade from 4.7, the recommended procedure is described in the
Installation Guide Chapter 9. In this procedure, you run the 
js-upgrade script:

  js-upgrade-samedb-ce.bat/sh
  

Upgrading Input Controls to 4.7.0 and later
-------------------------------------------

Prior to release 4.7, query-based input controls of type string
were allowed for queries that returned dates. As of release 4.7,
the type of the input control must match exactly the type of
the field returned by the query. You must manually update your
query-based input controls to use only controls of type date for
date values.

Query-based input controls also support the $X{} syntax now to
handle equality comparisons with null values as input. The
following query will fail when the value of <parameter> is null:

  select * where <column> = $P{<parameter>} 

Instead, use the following syntax:

  select * where $X{EQUAL, <column>, <parameter>}

The $X{EQUAL...} syntax generates the correct SQL to compare the
value of the parameter when it is null. For any other types of
comparison, such as greater than, use the $P{} syntax.
  

Security After Upgrading to versions 4.5.0 and later
----------------------------------------------------

With the security framework introduced in JasperReports Server 
4.5.0, user input and values passed to reports are restricted to 
avoid potential security threats. In particular:

* Parameter names and values cannot have tags (that is, the 
  < and > characters). If your business data contains tags, you 
  need to update the security configuration to allow them.

* SQL queries must start with SELECT and cannot have comments.
  If your reports or Domains have queries with comments, you
  must either remove the comments or update the security
  configuration to allow them.

These restrictions were added to comply with security guidelines
for web applications. Removing the restrictions may make the
application more vulnerable to attacks.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
7. Known Issues

* 10254: If your client application uses JasperReports Server's 
  web services to retrieve JasperReports binary files 
  (JasperPrint objects) your client application may crash when it  
  tries to retrieve a report that includes a chart. This is 
  caused by an incompatibility between the version of   
  JFreeCharts in your client application and the version of  
  JFreeCharts in JasperReports Server (currently 1.0.12). To  
  retrieve reports with charts using the web services, you  
  must upgrade your client application to use JFreeCharts 
  version 1.0.12.

  For more information, visit the JFreeCharts website at:
  http://www.jfree.org/

* 21798: Performance in Internet Explorer. When 
  JasperReports Server is accessed through Microsoft 
  Internet Explorer 7, performance may be impaired. 
  Jaspersoft recommends version 8 of Internet Explorer.
  
* 24226: If the JasperReports Server repository is hosted by
  PostgreSQL, your users' names are case-sensitive. This is not
  so for some other types of RDBMS. This is because PostgreSQL 
  defaults to case-sensitive. Jaspersoft will address this issue
  in a subsequent release.

* 24762: When installing JasperReports Server with the default
  settings on a Window 7 system that has a locale specified
  (such as Italian), the installer will fail with an error in
  initdb.exe. A bug in the Microsoft libraries prevents
  PostgreSQL from installing to a folder that is a symbolic link,
  such as the localized name of the default folder, "Program
  Files". As a workaround, specify a folder other than "Program
  Files" for the installation.

* 25644: Reset Admin passwords on upgrade operation. When using
  the js-upgrade-newdb.bat/sh upgrade script (described in
  the Installation Guide) the procedure sets the passwords for 
  the jasperadmin user back to its default value (jasperadmin). 
  Jaspersoft will address this issue in a subsequent release. 

* 28516: JasperReports Server supports both IE8 and IE9. However, 
  supporting both versions involves forcing IE9 to mimic IE8. If 
  you embed JasperReports Server in another application using an 
  iframe HTML element, the page that embeds the iframe must also 
  force IE9 to mimic IE8. The HTTP header of that page must set 
  the document compatibility to IE8. For example: 
  meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=8"/>

* 30176: In certain configurations, JasperReports Server returns 
  an exception  when users click the Change Data Cube button in 
  an OLAP view: 
  javax.xml.transform.TransformerConfigurationException

  To workaround the problem, set your virtual machine's 
  JAVA_OPTS -D setting. For example:
    -Djavax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory=org.apache.xalan.
     processor.TransformerFactoryImpl
