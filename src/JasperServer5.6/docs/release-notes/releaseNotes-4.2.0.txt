1. Introduction

JasperReports Server Community Project is a high-performance,
standalone and embeddable Business Intelligence (BI) platform 
that provides rich reporting capabilities. In addition, 
Jaspersoft OLAP provides OLAP data analysis running on the same 
shared BI platform. 

These release notes describe the installation and available 
functionality at a high level; for details, please refer to the 
documentation, which is available at <js-install>/docs after 
installation. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. Installation and Login

To install JasperReports Server, you can use the binary 
installer, which is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac.
This installer will optionally put Tomcat, Java, and MySQL 
onto your system so that JasperReports Server is ready to run.

The installers can be downloaded from the following location
http://jasperforge.org/projects/jasperserver/downloads:

  jasperreports-server-cp-4.1.0-<osType>-x86-installer.<ext>  (32 bit)
  
  jasperreports-server-cp-4.1.0-<osType>-x64-installer.<ext>  (64 bit)

To install, double-click the installer and click Next on all
screens to do a default installation. The installer can also
be run from the command line. For login information, see the 
sections below.

For more information on JasperReports Server installation, 
refer to the Install Guide, which is found at:

  <js-install>/docs/JasperReports-Server-CP-Install-Guide.pdf

Additionally, there are new "auto-install" command line based 
shell scripts. These scripts can be used if you are installing 
to these databases: 

  PostgreSQL
  MySQL

And these application servers: 

  JBoss
  Glassfish
  Tomcat 

For information on the auto-install scripts, see Chapter 
5 of the Install Guide. To run the auto-install scripts, 
download the WAR File Distribution ZIP file from the 
JasperForge.org downloads/releases area. The file name is:

  jasperreports-server-cp-4.1.0-bin.zip

To login after installation, use the following URL:

  http://<hostname>:8080/jasperserver

During installation, a default administrative user is created:

  User: jasperadmin  Password: jasperadmin

If you install the sample data, a sample end-user is created:

  User: joeuser      Password: joeuser
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------
3. Starting and Stopping

If you installed using the binary installer, this section covers
starting and stopping. Refer to the Installation Guide for full 
information.

Windows:

  You can start and stop from the Windows menus:
  
  Programs > JasperReports Server CP > Start and Stop > (start or 
  stop Service)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
4. Upgrade Notes 


You may upgrade directly to 4.1.0 if your instance is one of the 
following:

  3.7.0
  3.7.1
  4.0.0
  
The recommended upgrade procedures are fully described in the 
Install Guide.

To upgrade, you will start with the WAR File Distribution ZIP
(jasperreports-server-cp-4.1.0-bin.zip). It can be downloaded from 
the JasperForge Releases/Downloads area.

There are no database changes between 4.0.0 and 4.1.0. So, the
upgrade from 4.0.0 to 4.1 is simpler. 


4.0.0 to 4.1.0
--------------

To upgrade from 4.0.0 to 4.1, the recommended procedure
is described in the Installation Guide Chapter 8 "Upgrade from 
4.0.0 to 4.1.0". In this procedure, you will run the "auto-upgrade"
script:

  js-upgrade-samedb-ce.bat/sh


3.7.0 to 4.1.0
--------------

You can upgrade directly to 4.1.0 from version 3.7.0 or 3.7.1. 

The recommended procedure is described in Install Guide 
Chapter 7 "Upgrade from 3.7.0 to 4.1.0". In this procedure, you
will run the "auto-upgrade" script:

  js-upgrade-newdb-ce.bat/sh


-----------------------------------------------------------------
5. What's New

JasperReports Server now includes the following:

  * Support for five additional languages with resource
    bundles. For this release we have added language 
    resource bundles for Chinese, French, German, Japanese,
    and Spanish. This is in addition to the default English
    language bundles.

  * Support for 64 bit Installers. 
    You can now download either 32 bit or 64 bit installers. 
    The 64 bit installers contain a 64 bit version of Java 6
    and a 64 bit version of MySQL 5.1 as bundled components. 
    The 64 bit Java 6 JVM is known to run JasperReports Server
    with greater speed and performance. 

  * Localization of Input Controls - In previous releases, the 
    labels applied to a report's input controls could only 
    support a single language. Now, you can supply resource 
    bundles that define the input control's labels in various 
    languages. In addition, if the input control relies on a 
    fixed list of values, the list of values can also support 
    multiple languages. For more information, refer to the 
    JasperReports Server Community Project User Guide.

  * Templates. Some changes have been made to the server's UI 
    components:
     
    * In order to support certain application servers, some 
      JSP files (in /templates) have been renamed so that
      the names do not include the hash mark (#). These pages
      represent all types of dialogs (such as the About
      dialog and the Save As dialog), as opposed to generic
      components, such as page.jsp or container.jsp. All
      references to these JSPs in the other pages have also
      been updated.
       
    * In the file system of the server's host, the templates 
      folder has been moved from:
        jasperserver-pro/WEB-INF/jsp/modules/templates/ 
          to 
        jasperserver-pro/WEB-INF/jsp/templates/ 
         
      That is, it has been moved up one level.


JasperReports Server 4.0 added these improvements:

  * Product Naming. Several changes have been made to  
    Jaspersoft's product names; in particular: 
    * The former "JasperServer" is called "JasperReports Server" 
    * The former "JasperAnalysis" is called "Jaspersoft OLAP" 
  
     These changes are reflected by our products, 
     documentation, and web content. 
  
  * Improved User Interface. The usability and look and feel of 
    the JasperReports Server web user interface has been 
    improved to simplify many user tasks and to make it more 
    visually appealing. The underlying framework introduced as 
    part of this feature (Jaspersoft Interface Framework (JIF)) 
    allows the application's look and feel to be modified more 
    quickly and easily than in previous releases. Note that some 
    types of customization may need to be implemented in a 
    different way in this version than in previous versions.

  * Application Themes. JasperReports Server now supports the 
    ability to define themes for the web interface that control 
    its look and feel. These themes take advantage of JIF to let 
    users define Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), images, and other 
    graphical elements of the application. Themes are stored in 
    the repository and can be updated without the need to restart 
    the server. 

  * Macintosh Installer Support. This release includes an  
    installer for Macintosh computers. For more information, 
    refer to the Installation Notes section of this document 
    and to the JasperReports Server Installation Guide. 
    
  * Installer Components Updated. The JasperReports Server
    installers have been updated to provide more current 
    applications:
    * Tomcat has been updated from 5.5 to 6.0. 
    * MySQL has been updated from 5.0 to 5.1. 
    * Java has been updated from 1.5 to 1.6.
    
  * Buildomatic Ant Install Scripts Updated. In addition to the 
    binary installers (Windows, Linux, and Mac) the buildomatic 
    installation files have been upgraded with auto-install and
    auto-upgrade batch/shell scripts. Now a single properties 
    file and a single script execution complete most steps for 
    installing or upgrading the server.

  * Updated OLAP Engine. This release includes a new version of 
    Mondrian, the OLAP engine underlying Jaspersoft OLAP. The 
    new version of Mondrian is 3.2.0. Major improvements 
    include:
    
     * Improved native performance
     * olap4j drill through support
     * Improved XML/A support
     * Greenplum Dialect
     * Improved parameter support

  * Execute-only Permission. A new level of access has been added 
    for repository objects. Execute-only permission gives 
    administrators finer control over what users see in the 
    repository. As in a file system, execute-only permission 
    allows regular users to access resources at run-time but 
    not browse or search for them in the repository. For example, 
    placing data sources in an execute-only folder allows users  
    to run reports and access the data, but hides the data 
    sources from the end user. Administrators can use the
    execute-only permission to hide supporting resources so that 
    end-users interact with only reports and OLAP views in the 
    repository. 

  * Log Setting Page. The new log settings page, accessible to 
    administration users by clicking Manage > Log Settings, lets 
    you change the  logging levels without restarting 
    JasperReports Server.
    
  * New JasperReports version 4.0.0 is included in JasperReports 
    Server. A new CSV query executer is added to simplify the
    configuring of CSV data sources. Also, a new CSV metadata
    exporter has been added to better control the CSV export. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
6. Known Issues

* 10254: If your client application uses JasperReports Server's 
  web services to retrieve JasperReports binary files 
  (JasperPrint objects) your client application may crash when it  
  tries to retrieve a report that includes a chart. This is 
  caused by an incompatibility between the version of   
  JFreeCharts in your client application and the version of  
  JFreeCharts in JasperReports Server (currently 1.0.12). To  
  retrieve reports with charts using the web services, you  
  must upgrade your client application to use JFreeCharts 
  version 1.0.12.

  For more information, visit the JFreeCharts website at:
  http://www.jfree.org/

* 21798: Performance in Internet Explorer. When 
  JasperReports Server is accessed through Microsoft 
  Internet Explorer 7, performance may be impaired. 
  Jaspersoft recommends version 8 of Internet Explorer.
       
* 21835: Mac Installer. When installing to an  existing MySQL
  instance, some users report errors when a previous  
  installation of JasperReports Server exists. Until fixed, 
  Jaspersoft recommends that you use the bundled version of 
  MySQL.

* 21953: This version of JasperReports Server doesn't support 
  MySQL 5.5. Jaspersoft plans to support this version of MySQL
  in a subsequent release.


These defects, which were listed in the release notes of 
previous versions, have been fixed in this release:

* 20412: (fixed) Import-Export Help. The --help option for the
  js-import and js-export utilities was not displayed if database 
  connection couldn't be made. Now, the --help option returns 
  information even if the database connection fails.

* 21580: (fixed) Import operation, cached permissions. After an
  import operation, if the import included permission changes to
  files or folders, cached permissions could interfere with the
  new permissions. Now, permission changes made during import are
  properly applied.
