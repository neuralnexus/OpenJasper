1. Introduction

JasperReports Server Community Project is a high-performance,
standalone and embeddable Business Intelligence (BI) platform 
that provides rich reporting capabilities. In addition, 
Jaspersoft OLAP provides  data analysis running on the same 
shared BI platform. 

These release notes describe the installation and available 
functionality at a high level; for details, please refer to the 
documentation, which is available at <js-install>/docs after 
installation. In particular, refer to the Installation Guide for 
instructions about running the installer, creating and updating 
the database, deploying the WAR file, and upgrading from 
previous versions.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. What's New

JasperReports Server now includes the following:

  * iPad Support - JasperReports Server's web application now
    supports the Apple iPad running the Safari browser. In 
    this release, the server supports viewing content (such as
    browsing the repository; running and copying reports; and 
    viewing dashboards) and creating Ad Hoc reports. 
 
  * Interactive HTML reports - Using JasperReports Server, you
    can now publish reports that allow users to sort or filter 
    in the browser. Users click to modify these reports 
    on-the-fly. Interactivity is available for all reports 
    that use the table component. 

  * New HTML Output - The server includes a new XHTML exporter
    that is less strict with regard to overlapping HTML
    elements. You can specify whether the server uses the
    pre-existing HTML exporter or the new XHTML exporter. If
    you want your table component reports to be interactive,
    JasperReports Server must use the XHTML exporter.
    
  * REST API - JasperReports Server now includes web services
    based on the REST (Representational State Transfer) style of
    architecture. In this release, the RESTful services allow
    you to access repository functionality, such as getting,
    putting, posting, and deleting objects in the repository. 

  * Database Server Support:
  
    * PostgreSQL - The bundled database installed by default with
      JasperReports Server has changed from MySQL to PostgreSQL
      9.0.4. JasperReports Server continues to support a wide
      range of databases, including MySQL. MySQL users can set up
      JasperReports Server during installation to connect to their
      existing MySQL database. 

      In earlier releases, Jaspersoft also provided and installed
      the driver for the MySQL database. The installer no longer
      provides this driver. MySQL 5.1 users can download the JDBC
      driver, mysql-connector-java-5.1.17-bin.jar, from this web
      site: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

    * An existing (unbundled) PostgreSQL instance can be 
      located on a remote host. You need to enable remote 
      connections in the PostgreSQL configuration. See the 
      JasperReports Server Installation Guide for more 
      information. 

    * JasperReports Server now supports MySQL 5.5 as a data
      source. Note that MySQL 5.5 is not currently supported as 
      a repository database (see Known Issues).
      
  * Application Server Support - JasperReports Server now 
    supports Tomcat 7.0, and recommends version 7.0.19 or later.

  * Updated versions of JasperReports Library and iReport 
    Designer - JasperReports Server 4.2.1 includes JasperReports 
    Library and iReport Designer 4.2.1, which include support for 
    PDF/A compliant PDF export, and the ability to apply 
    interactivity (sorting or filtering) to report components.
    

JasperReports Server 4.1 added these improvements:

  * Support for five additional languages - In this release, we 
    added language resource bundles for Chinese, French, German, 
    Japanese, and Spanish. This is in addition to the default 
    English language bundles.

  * Support for 64 bit Installers - You can now download either 
    32 bit or 64 bit installers. The 64 bit installers contain 
    a 64 bit version of Java 6 and a 64 bit version of PostgreSQL 
    5.1 as bundled components. The 64 bit Java 6 JVM is known to 
    run JasperReports Server with greater speed and performance. 

  * Localization of Input Controls - In previous releases, the 
    labels applied to a report's input controls could only 
    support a single language. Now, you can supply resource 
    bundles that define the input control's labels in various 
    languages. In addition, if the input control relies on a 
    fixed list of values, the list of values can also support 
    multiple languages. For more information, refer to the 
    JasperReports Server Community Project User Guide.

  * Templates. Some changes have been made to the server's UI 
    components:
     
    * In order to support certain application servers, some 
      JSP files (in /templates) have been renamed so that
      the names do not include the hash mark (#). These pages
      represent all types of dialogs (such as the About
      dialog and the Save As dialog), as opposed to generic
      components, such as page.jsp or container.jsp. All
      references to these JSPs in the other pages have also
      been updated.
       
    * In the file system of the server's host, the templates 
      folder has been moved from:
        jasperserver/WEB-INF/jsp/modules/templates/ 
          to 
        jasperserver/WEB-INF/jsp/templates/ 
         
      That is, it has been moved up one level.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
3. Installation and Login

To install JasperReports Server, you can use the binary 
installer, which is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac. This 
installer optionally puts Tomcat, Java, and PostgreSQL onto your 
system so that JasperReports Server is ready to run.

The installers can be downloaded from the following location
http://jasperforge.org/projects/jasperserver/downloads:

  jasperreports-server-cp-4.2.1-<osType>-x86-installer.<ext>  (32 bit)
  
  jasperreports-server-cp-4.2.1-<osType>-x64-installer.<ext>  (64 bit)

To install, double-click the installer and click Next on all
windows to accept the default installation. The installer can 
also be run from the command line. For login information, see 
the sections below.

For more information on JasperReports Server installation, 
refer to the Installation Guide, which is found at:

  <js-install>/docs/JasperReports-Server-CP-Install-Guide.pdf

Additionally, the auto-install command line based shell scripts 
can be used if you are installing to these databases: 

  PostgreSQL
  MySQL

And these application servers: 

  JBoss
  Glassfish
  Tomcat 

For information on the auto-install scripts, see Chapter 
5 of the Install Guide. To run the auto-install scripts, 
download the WAR File Distribution ZIP file from the 
JasperForge.org downloads/releases area. The file name is:

  jasperreports-server-cp-4.2.1-bin.zip

To login after installation, use the following URL:

  http://<hostname>:8080/jasperserver

During installation, a default administrative user is created:

  User: jasperadmin  Password: jasperadmin

If you install the sample data, a sample end-user is created:

  User: joeuser      Password: joeuser
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------
4. Starting and Stopping

If you installed using the binary installer, this section covers
starting and stopping. Refer to the Installation Guide for full 
information.

Windows:

  You can start and stop from the Windows menus:
  
  Programs > JasperReports Server CP > Start and Stop > (start or 
  stop Service)

Linux: 

  You can start and stop from the command line:

  ./<js-install>/ctlscript.sh  (start | stop)

5. Upgrade Notes 


You can upgrade directly to 4.2.1 if your instance is one of the 
following:

  3.7.0
  3.7.1
  4.0.0
  4.1.0
  
Note that Jaspersoft did not release a 4.2.0 version of 
JasperReports Server Community Project. The version number
progression goes from 4.1.0 to 4.2.1 directly.

The recommended upgrade procedures are fully described in the 
Installation Guide.

To upgrade, start with the WAR File Distribution ZIP
(jasperreports-server-cp-4.2.1-bin.zip). It can be downloaded 
from the JasperForge Releases/Downloads area.

There are no database changes between 4.0.0, 4.1.0, and 4.2.1. 
So, the upgrade from 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 to 4.2.1 is simpler than 
upgrading from earlier versions. 


4.0.0 or 4.1.0 to 4.2.1
--------------

To upgrade from 4.0.0 or 4.1.0 to 4.2.1, the recommended procedure
is described in the Installation Guide Chapter 8 "Upgrade from 
4.0.0 to 4.2". In this procedure, you run the auto-upgrade
script:

  js-upgrade-samedb-ce.bat/sh


3.7.0 to 4.2.1
--------------

You can upgrade directly to 4.2.1 from version 3.7.0 or 3.7.1. 

The recommended procedure is described in Installation Guide 
Chapter 7 "Upgrade from 3.7.0 to 4.2". In this procedure, you
run the auto-upgrade script:

  js-upgrade-newdb-ce.bat/sh


-----------------------------------------------------------------
6. Known Issues

* 10254: If your client application uses JasperReports Server's 
  web services to retrieve JasperReports binary files 
  (JasperPrint objects) your client application may crash when it  
  tries to retrieve a report that includes a chart. This is 
  caused by an incompatibility between the version of   
  JFreeCharts in your client application and the version of  
  JFreeCharts in JasperReports Server (currently 1.0.12). To  
  retrieve reports with charts using the web services, you  
  must upgrade your client application to use JFreeCharts 
  version 1.0.12.

  For more information, visit the JFreeCharts website at:
  http://www.jfree.org/

* 21798: Performance in Internet Explorer. When 
  JasperReports Server is accessed through Microsoft 
  Internet Explorer 7, performance may be impaired. 
  Jaspersoft recommends version 8 of Internet Explorer.

* 21953: This version of JasperReports Server doesn't support 
  MySQL 5.5 as a repository database host. Jaspersoft plans to
  support this configuration in a subsequent release.
  
These defects, which were listed in the release notes of 
previous versions, were fixed in this release:

* 21835: (fixed) Mac Installer. When installing to an existing 
  MySQL instance, some users report errors when a previous  
  installation of JasperReports Server exists. Because MySQL
  is no longer part of our installation, Jaspersoft has 
  determined that this issue no longer occurs.
  
* 21953: (partially fixed) Previous versions of JasperReports
  Server didn't support MySQL 5.5 as a data source. JasperReports
  Server now supports MySQL 5.5 as a data source. However, the
  server does not support it as a repository database.

* 23235: (fixed) In a previous release, Jaspersoft reported a
  conflict between JAR files when the application was hosted by
  Glassfish version 2. The JasperReports Server JARs in question
  were WEB-INF/lib/jackson-core-lgpl-1.7.4 and
  jackson-mapper-lgpl-1.7.4. Jaspersoft has determined that this
  issue no longer occurs.

These defects, which were listed in the release notes of 
previous versions, were fixed in the 4.1 release:

* 20412: (fixed) Import-Export Help. The --help option for the
  js-import and js-export utilities was not displayed if a 
  database connection couldn't be made. Now, the --help option 
  returns information even if the database connection fails.

* 21580: (fixed) Import operation, cached permissions. After an
  import operation, if the import included permission changes to
  files or folders, cached permissions could interfere with the
  new permissions. Now, permission changes made during import are
  properly applied.
