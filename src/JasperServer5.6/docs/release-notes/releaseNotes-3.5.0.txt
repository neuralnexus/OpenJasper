-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Introduction

JasperServer builds on JasperReports as a comprehensive family
of Business Intelligence (BI) products, providing robust static
and interactive reporting, report server, and data analysis 
capabilities. For business intelligence users, Jaspersoft offers
JasperAnalysis, which runs seamlessly on JasperServer. 

These release notes describe the installation and available 
functionality at a high level; for details, please refer to the 
documentation, which is available at <js-install>/docs
after installation. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. Installation Notes

For information on JasperServer installation, refer to the
install guide which is found at:

    <js-install>/docs/JasperServer-Install-Guide.pdf

Once JasperServer is installed, the login page URL is:

    http://<hostname>:<port>/jasperserver

The default login page URL for Tomcat is:

    http://<hostname>:8080/jasperserver

During installation, a default administrative user is 
created:

    Username: jasperadmin
    Password: jasperadmin

If you install the sample data, an end user is also 
created:

    Username:  joeuser
    Password:  joeuser


-----------------------------------------------------------------
3. Upgrade Notes

In JasperServer 3.5, user password encryption has been turned 
on by default to enhance security. Because most pre-3.5 
customers have not been running with encryption enabled, the 
upgrade steps need to account for this change. After the 
completed upgrade, users will not be able to login to 
JasperServer if the JIUser.password column has plain text
passwords.

In the Install Guide the recommended upgrade procedure uses the
new buildomatic scripts (and import-export) to handle upgrade.
In this case, password encryption from 3.1 to 3.5 is handled
automatically. 

See section 7, "Upgrade from JasperServer 3.0 or 3.1 to 3.5"
in the <js-install>/docs/JasperServer-Install-Guide.pdf for
detailed upgrade steps.

The script: 

<js-install>/scripts/upgrade/upgrade-mysql-3.1.0-3.5.0-WARNING.sql

does not handle password encryption automatically. If this script
is run, all passwords will still be unencrypted. See the comments
at the top of the script file for hints on how to handle 
encryption on the upgrade scenario.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
4. What's New

JasperServer now includes these features:

 * Upgrade Mondrian to 3.0
   - Dimension sharing within a cube
   - Support for dozens of new scalar functions in MDX

 * New JasperAnalysis UI 
   - Improved look and feel as well as an improved tool bar 
     within analysis views. 

 * Encrypt JDBC password
   - Export/Import now supports encryption of JDBC passwords.
   
 * Encrypt User password
   - User password encryption is now turned on by default.

 * Configurable Scheduler Intervals
   - The admin can decide which recurrence options are 
     displayed to users by editing the recurrenceIntervalUnits 
     bean in the WEB-INF/flows/reportJobBeans.xml.

 * Support for Gantt Charts in JasperReports (and bundled 
   iReport)
   - JasperReports, the Java reporting library at the heart 
     of JasperServer now supports Gantt charts.

 * Revamped user and role pages
   - Includes support for large numbers of users, including 
     search.

 * XML-based Chart Themes
   - iReport includes the ability to create and edit chart themes
     in a visual editor (rather than requiring programming 
     skills as was previously the case).

 * Font Extensions
   - JasperReports leverages its existing extension support to 
     allow the use of TTF files in report templates without 
     installing them into the system; the same logical font 
     name can be resolved into different TTF files depending 
     on the locale, covering multiple languages.

 * Multiple Scriplets per Report and Report Governors
   - JasperReports now allows multiple scriplet instances per 
     report template. Some such scriptlets can be declared 
     globally to act as report governors, preventing invalid 
     report layouts from causing infinite loops when the report
     is filled. JasperServer also provides default governor 
     implementations that limit report execution based on a 
     maximum number of pages and/or timeout.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
5. Known Issues

 * 10254: If your client application uses JasperServer's web 
   services to retrieve JasperReports, your client application 
   may crash when it tries to retrieve a report that includes 
   a chart. This is caused by an incompatibility between 
   JFreeCharts 1.0.0 and JFreeCharts 1.0.3. You man encounter 
   this issue when upgrading from JasperServer 2.1. To retrieve 
   reports with charts using the web services, you must 
   upgrade your client application to use JFreeCharts version 
   1.0.3.

   For more information, visit the JFreeCharts website at:
   http://www.jfree.org/

 * 11634: The JasperServer installers (Windows and Linux) do 
   not support special characters at the end of user entered 
   passwords. Such characters include: & ; $
      
 * 11847: When JasperServer is installed using the bundled 
   version of MySQL, and the computer already hosts a version
   of MySQL, the installer may fail with an error indicating
   that it couldn't connect to MySQL. This Windows-only problem
   occurs intermittently. The workaround is to uninstall
   JasperServer, reinstall it, and select the existing MySQL
   option.
