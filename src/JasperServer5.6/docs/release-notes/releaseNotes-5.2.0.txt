-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Introduction

JasperReports Server Community Project is a high-performance,
standalone and embeddable Business Intelligence (BI) platform 
that provides rich reporting capabilities. In addition, 
Jaspersoft OLAP provides data analysis running on the same 
shared BI platform. 

These release notes describe the installation and available 
functionality at a high level; for details, please refer to the 
documentation, which is available at <js-install>/docs after 
installation. In particular, refer to the Installation Guide for 
instructions about running the installer, creating and updating 
the database, deploying the WAR file, and upgrading from 
previous versions.

Note: JasperReports Server is governed by a License Agreement,
the text of which is found at <js-install>/license.txt. Please 
read it before you login to JasperReports Server for the first 
time. If you installed the server using the installer binary 
(rather than deploying a WAR file), you have already agreed to 
this license.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. What's New

JasperReports Server 5.2 is a maintenance release focused on 
software quality and user experience improvements. In addition to 
defect fixes, it includes these improvements:

 * Time Series Charts - Time series charts are now supported in 
   iReport and Jaspersoft Studio.These intelligent charts 
   automatically scale their x-axis intervals and skip missing 
   values in interval data.
 
 * REST v2 web services - Jaspersoft continues to expand and 
   improve the functionality of the REST web services. This 
   API allows client applications to interact with most 
   features of the server over HTTP using standard XML and JSON 
   objects. In this release, REST v2 includes support for 
   repository permissions. 
   
 * MariaDB JDBC Client Library - Jaspersoft now distributes the 
   open source MariaDB JDBC Client Library to provide JDBC 
   connectivity to compatible data sources, such as MariaDB and 
   MySQL. Users who previously had to download and install a 
   JDBC driver for these types of data sources can now access 
   them from the server without having to install a third-party 
   driver.
   

JasperReports Server 5.1 is a maintenance release focused on 
software quality and user experience improvements. It also 
includes these improvements:

 * A new translation of the web UI text into Brazilian 
   Portuguese.

 * Improved Single Sign-on (SSO) Support - A new customizable 
   bean API leverages the Spring Security framework to simplify 
   the creation and configuration of external authentication for 
   JasperReports Server. To configure this new API, create a 
   custom applicationContext file and place it in the WEB-INF 
   directory. Sample files for LDAP and CAS are included in the 
   standard distribution.
  
 * Improved Support for JDBC Data Sources - Jaspersoft has made
   the server's JDBC data sources easier to manage. In 
   particular, users can add new drivers through the web UI. 

 * Installation Improvements - The binary installer now sports 
   an improved user experience, including:
   - Express and Custom Install options. The Express option lets  
     you perform a full component install with a single click.
   - Disk space checks and display of required space for a full 
     installation.     
   - Smaller installation footprint. The installer no longer 
     includes iReport; please install this desktop client tool 
     separately.
 

 JasperReports Server 5.0 included these improvements:
    
 *  Relative Date Handling. Reports and dashboards now provide
    the ability to specify relative dates in input controls.
    For example, you could enter WEEK - 1 in a Start Date input 
    control to retrieve all the data for the last seven days. 
    Supported keywords in this release are DAY, WEEK, MONTH,
    QUARTER, SEMI (that is, half-year), and YEAR.

  * Report Viewer Improvements - The report viewer now offers 
    conditional formatting of table fields and an improved UI. 

  * Extended XML/A support - JasperReports Server can now connect 
    to Microsoft SQL Server Analytic Services to populate views 
    and reports with multi-dimensional OLAP data. For 
    configuration details, refer to the Jaspersoft OLAP User Guide.

  * Component upgrades - Jaspersoft has upgraded some third 
    party components of the server. Groovy 2.0 is a more powerful 
    scripting language with better type checking and static 
    compilation. EHCache provides the ability to measure
    memory usage and enforce limits on total memory usage.

  * User profile attributes - JasperReports Server now provides 
    access to user's profile attributes through the web UI's 
    Manage > Users page.
    
  * PHP SDK - This new package lets users interact with 
    JasperReports Server using PHP. A set of PHP classes wrap the 
    server's web services REST API with easy to use business 
    logic so that you can focus on your PHP application rather 
    than its interactions with the server.

Note: If you are upgrading from JasperReports Server version
4.5 (or earlier) there are changes in Input Controls and Security.
It is best to do some planning before the upgrade. Please refer to 
Installation Guide Chapter 7 for advice regarding these important 
considerations. Also, see the section (AAAAA) 6.6 of these Release Notes 
for information.

Database Changes
----------------

There are no database changes between version 5.1.0 and 5.2.0.


6.2 Upgrade from 5.1 to 5.2
---------------------------

To upgrade from 5.1.0, the recommended procedure is described in the
Installation Guide Chapter 8. This procedure is run from the command
line. Here is a summary of the steps used for this upgrade procedure: 

  cd <unpacked-dir>/buildomatic
 
  cp sample_conf/<dbType>_master.properties  default_master.properties

  edit default_master.properties  (add your app server and db properties)

  ./js-upgrade-samedb-ce.sh   (or js-upgrade-samedb-ce.bat)


6.3 Upgrade from Older JRS Versions
-----------------------------------

This upgrade procedure lets you upgrade from any of the
following JasperReports Server versions:

3.7.0, 3.7.1, 4.0.0, 4.1.0, 4.2.1, 4.5.0, 4.7.0, 5.0.0, or 5.1.0

The recommended procedure is described in the Installation Guide 
Chapter 9. This procedure is run from the command line. Here is a
summary of the steps used for this upgrade procedure: 

  Export your existing JasperReports Server repository data
  (using the buildomatic/js-export-ce.sh/bat command)
  (for example: ./js-export-ce.sh --everything --output-zip my-export.zip)

  cd <unpacked-dir>/buildomatic
 
  cp sample_conf/<dbType>_master.properties  default_master.properties

  edit default_master.properties  (add your app server and db properties)

  ./js-upgrade-newdb-ce.sh  <path>/my-export.zip 

  (or js-upgrade-newdb-ce.bat <path>/my-export.zip)


6.4 Important Upgrade Information
---------------------------------

6.4.1 Upgrading Input Controls from 4.7 and later

Prior to release 4.7, query-based input controls of type string
were allowed for queries that returned dates. As of release 4.7,
the type of the input control must match exactly the type of
the field returned by the query. You must manually update your
query-based input controls to use only controls of type date for
date values.

Query-based input controls also support the $X{} syntax now to
handle equality comparisons with null values as input. The
following query will fail when the value of <parameter> is null:

  select * where <column> = $P{<parameter>} 

Instead, use the following syntax:

  select * where $X{EQUAL, <column>, <parameter>}

The $X{EQUAL...} syntax generates the correct SQL to compare the
value of the parameter when it is null. For any other types of
comparison, such as greater than, use the $P{} syntax.
  

6.4.2 Security After Upgrading to versions 4.5 and later

With the security framework introduced in JasperReports Server 
4.5, user input and values passed to reports are restricted to 
avoid potential security threats. In particular:

* Parameter names and values cannot have tags (that is, the 
  < and > characters). If your business data contains tags, you 
  need to update the security configuration to allow them.

* SQL queries must start with SELECT and cannot have comments.
  If your reports or Domains have queries with comments, you
  must either remove the comments or update the security
  configuration to allow them.

These restrictions were added to comply with security guidelines
for web applications. Removing the restrictions may make the
application more vulnerable to attacks.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
7. Known Issues

* 10254: If your client application uses JasperReports Server's
  web services to retrieve JasperReports binary files
  (JasperPrint objects) your client application may crash when it
  tries to retrieve a report that includes a chart. This is
  caused by an incompatibility between the version of 
  JFreeCharts available in your client application and the
  version of JFreeCharts available in JasperReports Server
  (currently 1.0.12). To retrieve reports with charts using
  the web services, you must upgrade your client application to
  use JFreeCharts version 1.0.12.

  For more information, visit the JFreeCharts website at:
  http://www.jfree.org/

* 21798: Performance in Internet Explorer. When
  JasperReports Server is accessed through Microsoft
  Internet Explorer 8, performance may be impaired. Jaspersoft 
  recommends version 9 or 10 of Internet Explorer.
  
  Internet Explorer users should also note a change to 
  Jaspersoft's Certification Level for IE7. While later 
  versions of this browser are Certified, IE7 is Compatible. 
  Jaspersoft has changed this level due to concerns about IE7's 
  behavior and performance. 

  For more information about these support level definitions, 
  please see the Platform Support document available from the 
  Support Portal.
  
* 32159: When the 64-bit JasperReports Server binary installer 
  is run in some versions of Mac OSX (including Mac OSX 10.8.3), 
  and you select the option to install the bundled PostgreSQL, 
  an error appears if PostgreSQL 9.1 is already installed. The 
  message indicates that the process couldn't create a shared 
  memory segment, and directs you to further information in the 
  PostgreSQL documentation. For example, see 
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/kernel-resources.html, 
  which describes a workaround for the problem. Jaspersoft has 
  determined that this workaround can resolve the issue in the 
  JasperReports Server installer.

  Since the problem originates in the PostgreSQL installer, 
  Jaspersoft has no plans for its resolution.
   
* 32168: Though Jaspersoft does not strictly support the 
  practice, in previous versions of JasperReports Server, it 
  was possible to create a clone install in JBoss by copying an 
  existing JasperReports Server WAR file and deploying it to a 
  new JBoss instance. With 5.1, Jaspersoft supports JBoss 
  AS7/EAP6, but has uncovered issues with clone installs. For 
  more information, refer to http://tinyurl.com/cv6ta2l.


These defects, which were listed in the release notes of previous
versions, have been fixed in JasperReports Server 5.1:

* 24226: (fixed) If the JasperReports Server repository was 
  hosted by PostgreSQL, your users' names were case-sensitive. 
  The server now treats users' names case-insensitively. 

* 24762: (fixed) Under certain circumstances when installing on a 
  Windows 7 system, the installer failed with an error in 
  initdb.exe. The root of the problem, which originates in a 
  problem between Microsoft Windows and PostgreSQL, is the use 
  of a symbolic link in the path to the installation directory. 
  Jaspersoft has implemented a new feature that prevents this 
  failure.

* 25644: (fixed) The js-upgrade-newdb.bat/sh upgrade script used 
  during upgrades set the passwords for the superuser and 
  jasperadmin back to their default values. The script has been 
  corrected and the passwords are no longer reset.

* 28516: (fixed) JasperReports Server supports both IE8 and IE9. 
  However, supporting both in previous versions of the server 
  involved forcing IE9 to mimic IE8. In this version of the
  server, IE9 is no longer forced to mimic IE8. The workaround
  needed in previous versions (the addition of a meta tag to 
  any page that used an iframe to embed the server's pages) is 
  no longer required.

* 30176: (fixed) In certain configurations, JasperReports Server 
  returned an exception when users clicked the Change Data Cube 
  button in an OLAP view. Jaspersoft changed the way the server 
  calls the Xalan transformation factory, and the exception no 
  longer occurs.
