1. Introduction

JasperServer builds on JasperReports as a comprehensive family of
Business Intelligence (BI) products, providing robust static and 
interactive reporting, report server, and data analysis 
capabilities. For business intelligence users, JasperSoft offers
JasperAnalysis, which runs seamlessly on JasperServer. 

These release notes describe the installation and available 
functionality at a high level; for details, please refer to the 
documentation, which is available at <install-dir>/docs
after installation. In particular, refer to the installation 
guide for instructions about installation tasks, such as running 
the installer, creating and updating the database, and deploying 
the WAR file.

3. What's New

JasperServer now includes these features:

    * iReport for NetBeans - The latest version of iReport is 
      implemented using Sun's NetBeans technology. It also 
      includes an improved user interface. This version of 
      JasperServer includes the latest version of iReport.

    * Chart Themes - JasperServer's default charting look and
      feel has been updated and improved. Administrators can
      also create new chart themes and apply them at the level
      of either the server or the individual report.

     * Components API - JasperServer now supports an Application Programming
      Interface to allow the use of third party visual components, including
      but not limited to charting solutions other than JFreeCharts
      (JasperServer's default charting package). Using a different charting
      package can allow you to create a wider range of charts or support
      different appearances and behavior.

    * 508 Complaint PDF output - JasperReports now can now 
      produce PDF output that is compliant with Section 508 
      Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which 
      governs accessibility of software solutions for people 
      with disabilities. This version of JasperServer includes 
      the latest version of JasperReports. For more information,
      about Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 
      1973, see http://www.section508.gov.

4. Known Issues

    * 10254: If your client application uses JasperServer's web 
      services to retrieve JasperReports, your client application 
      may crash when it tries to retrieve a report that includes 
      a chart. This is caused by an incompatibility between 
      JFreeCharts 1.0.0 and JFreeCharts 1.0.3. To retrieve 
      reports with charts using the web services, you must 
      upgrade your client application to use JFreeCharts version 
      1.0.3.

      For more information, visit the JFreeCharts website at:
      http://www.jfree.org/

    * 11634: The JasperServer installers (Windows and Linux) do 
      not support special characters at the end of user entered 
      passwords. Such characters include: & ; $
      
    * 11847: When JasperServer is installed using the bundled 
      version of MySQL, and the computer already hosts a version
      of MySQL, the installer may fail with an error indicating
      that it couldn't connect to MySQL. This Windows-only problem
      occurs intermittently. The workaround is to uninstall
      JasperServer, reinstall it, and select the existing MySQL
      option. JasperSoft will address this issue in a subsequent
      release.
