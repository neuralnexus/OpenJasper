1. Introduction

JasperServer Community Edition is a high-performance,
standalone and embeddable Business Intelligence (BI) platform 
that provides rich reporting capabilities. In addition, 
JasperAnalysis provides OLAP data analysis, running on the same 
shared JasperServer BI platform. 

These release notes describe the installation and available 
functionality at a high level; for details, please refer to the 
documentation, which is available at <js-install>/docs after 
installation. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. Installation Notes

For information on JasperServer installation, refer to the
install guide which is found at:

    <js-install>/docs/JasperServer-CE-Install-Guide.pdf

Once JasperServer is installed, the login page URL is:

    http://<hostname>:<port>/jasperserver

The default login page URL for Tomcat is:

    http://<hostname>:8080/jasperserver

During installation, a default administrative user is 
created:

    Username: jasperadmin
    Password: jasperadmin

If you install the sample data, an end user is also 
created:

    Username:  joeuser
    Password:  joeuser

3. Upgrade Notes 

For JasperServer Community Edition there are two upgrade paths:
1. Utilize the import-export utility to move resources
   from your existing JasperServer instance to your new 3.7 
   instance. 
2. Do an "in-place" database upgrade using an SQL upgrade script. 

Refer to these chapters of the JasperServer CE Installation 
Guide for upgrade instructions: 

    Chapter:  Upgrade from JasperServer 3.5 to 3.7
  
    Chapter:  Upgrade Using SQL Upgrade Script

The upgrade scripts are located at:

    <js-install>/scripts/upgrade/      OR

-----------------------------------------------------------------
5. Known Issues

* 10254: If your client application uses JasperServer's web
  services to retrieve JasperReports binary files (JasperPrint
  objects) your client application may crash when it tries to 
  retrieve a report that includes a chart. This is caused by an
  incompatibility between the version of JFreeCharts available  
  in your client application and the version of JFreeCharts 
  available in JasperServer (currently 1.0.12). To retrieve 
  reports with charts using the web services, you must upgrade 
  your client application to use JFreeCharts version 1.0.12.

  For more information, visit the JFreeCharts website at:
  http://www.jfree.org/
      
* 11847: When JasperServer is installed using the bundled 
  version of MySQL, and the computer already hosts a version
  of MySQL, the installer may fail with an error indicating
  that it couldn't connect to MySQL. This Windows-only 
  problem occurs intermittently, and is typically seen when
  the computer where you are installing JasperServer is
  slow or is otherwise under load. The workaround is to 
  uninstall JasperServer, reinstall it, and select the 
  existing MySQL option. You should also stop any services
  that may be running.
