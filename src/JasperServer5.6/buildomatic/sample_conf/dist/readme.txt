buildomatic/dist/readme.txt
---------------------------

This folder is for helping with bootstrapping buildomatic. 
For example, a new developer wants to get all the peices in 
place. 



2010-09-23: NOTE: The default_master.properties file is out of date
                  Needs some updating and possibly some clean up. 

- There is also a folder named test. It has ingres setup files in it
  these should be kept around. Ingres is not officially "certified" by
  QA. But the property files should already function properly. 

- There is a file newer-init.properties. It has a bunch of comments at
  the top of the file on how init.properties can be used by developers
  within buildomatic for help in handling multiple source code bases.
  - init.properties and newer-init.properties should be merged.
