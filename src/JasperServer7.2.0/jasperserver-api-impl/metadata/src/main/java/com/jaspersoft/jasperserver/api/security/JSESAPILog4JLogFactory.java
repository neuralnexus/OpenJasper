 * This is a custom ESAPI org.owasp.esapi.reference.Log4JLogFactory.
 * It was introduced to avoid collision with jboss 7 log4j handling.
 * The collision happened in org.owasp.esapi.reference.Log4JLogFactory#getLogger(String): ClassCastException
 * This happened because jboss 7 cause log4j's LogManager to return org.jboss.logging.Logger instead of esapi one.
