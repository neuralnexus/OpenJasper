/**
 * Shim class for java.sql.Driver.
 * It is used to load any jdbc driver in runtime.
 *
 * We could not register any jdbc driver which was loaded in runtime
 * in java.sql.DriverManager because it only accepts drivers which was loaded by system classloader.
 *
 * Thus we use this class (which is loaded with application, using system class loader)
 * to register it in DriverManager. Then instance of this class will redirect
 * all method calls to underlying real jdbc driver instance which was loaded in runtime (not by system class loader)
