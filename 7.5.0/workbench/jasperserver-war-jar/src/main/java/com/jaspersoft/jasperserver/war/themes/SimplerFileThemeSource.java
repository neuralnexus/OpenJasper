/**
 * ThemeSource implementation which serves theme file requests directly from webapp files.
 * It doesn't require a message catalog, which you have to use for ResourceBundleThemeSource,
 * because it uses a MessageSource which figures out the resource path from the theme name
 * and the name of the requested resource.
 * It's currently hardcoded to use the convention "themes/[themeName]/[resourceName]".
 * 
 * To enable:
 * - comment out the beans "themeSource", "themeResolver", and "jsThemeResolver"
 * - add this class as "themeSource"
 *       <bean id="themeSource" class="com.jaspersoft.jasperserver.war.themes.SimplerFileThemeSource"/>
 * - uncomment the "themeResolver" bean using FixedThemeResolver
 *  
 * This will set a fixed theme based on whatever you put in the fixed theme resolver.
 * However, I don't see why you couldn't leave in the normal themeResolver bean.
