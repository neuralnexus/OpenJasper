 * This class extends AccessDeniedHandlerImpl to make it aware of some JRS specific attributes.
 * Normal servlet dispatching is done by DispatchServlet which takes care of ThemeResolver, LocaleResolver, etc.
 * However in case of flow errors (like, access to a view is denied), it happens before DispatchServlet.
 * To make error page be able to use themes and proper locale, this class injects the required attributes info into request
